## Hypothecation
* Hypothecation occurs when an asset is pledged as collateral to secure loan
  * Title and ownership still lies with borrower
  * Ownership would be transferred if terms of agreement were not met by borrower
  * When security buyers buy on margin or sell-short, they agree securities can be sold if necessary if there is a margin call

## Rehypothecation
* Banks would make use of client's asset that was posted as Collateral
* Clients should permit to make use of their collateral to be used as Rehypothecatable
* Examples:
  * Hedge fund posted its asset as Collateral to prime-broker, that asset being used by PM for its own transaction


## Margin account
* It is a brokerage account, where broker *lends* money for customer to buy securities
  * The loan in the account is collateralized by securities purchased and cash.
  * It has interest rate for the loan that was exercized.
  * Margin accounts are used as source of fund using existing securities

## Rehypothecation risks
* What happens if Banks that rehypothecated client's asset (or broker) default, and client would end-up in ITM?
