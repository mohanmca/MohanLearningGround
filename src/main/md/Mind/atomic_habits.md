# Atomic Habits
* Spending atleast 2 minutes for something that we like to improve
* Aggregation of marginal gains

# Why Habits?
* Good Habits create freedom.
  * Good financial habits vs Bad financial habits
  * Good health habits vs Bad health habits
  * Good gtd habits vs Bad gtd habits
  
# How Habits formed?
* Cue - Different Cue for different person
* Crave - Motivational force
* Response - Habit
* Reward - Satisfy/Teachus
* Cue|Crave|Response|Reward
* (Cue|Crave=Problem Phase)|(Response|Reward=Solution Phase)
* bored|need_to_do_be_entertained|watch_netflix|enjoy_entertainment
* We associate problem phase with solution
* Cue - Difficult office task, crave for relief, response - check twitter, reward - relieved (if office issue, check twitter) 

# Cue
* Unconscious cues?
* Conscious Cues?

# Crave
* What we crave for is the state change (not habit itself)
* Craving for feeling of relief than Cigarette
* Craving for entertainment than Television
* Craving for clean month than brushing

# Why habit won't be formed
* Lack of cue, habit will not start
* Reduce the craving, reduce the motivation
* Make habit difficult such that we can't do that, we won't even start
* Rewards fails to satisfy, then habit becomes useless

# To Create Habit
* Cue: Make it obvious (clear)
* Craving: Make it attractive
* Response: Make it easy
* Reward: Make it satisfying

# Habit formation
* Prepare Habit table
* Point and call (don't just think)
  * After 3:00PM, I would book flight ticket (loud and clear)
* Specify DTP, (date, time and place) to perform a habit
  * Everyday 5:55PM, I would double check the office todo
* Habit Stacking - Diderot Effect
  * One spending leads to another, one purchase leads to another, One habit can be stacked with another   
  * Right after brushing my teeth, I would weigh my weight, and do 10 push ups at the hall.
  
# To find a bad Habit
* List all your habits
* Score +/-/=
* Say loud before every habit and its consequences

# To break a bad Habit
* Cue: Make it invisible (clear)
* Craving: Make it un-attractive
* Response: Make it hard
* Reward: Make it unsatisfying
    
# Pointing and Calling
* Use eyes, mouth, ear and hands
* "I have got my keys, wallet, phone, train-pass and ear-phone"

# Quotes
* Until you make unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you call it fate - Carl Jung
* Plant a tiny seed in right spot, and it will grow without coaxing
* B=F(P,E) = Behaviour is function of person in an environment 
* B=MATHS = Behaviour = Motivation + Ability + Trigger + Habit + Success

* After I pour a cup of tea, I will do a 30-second plank.
* After I go the restroom, I will do four or five push-ups.
* After I walk in my office, I will do 10-15 reverse dumbbell flies.
* After I walk in my apartment, I will do 10-15 lateral dumbbell raises.
* After I watch video, I will leave a comment

# If habits are not sticking
* Do we really need it? Do we really love that skill/output?
* Do we despararately need them?
* Are there anything more important than what we try?
