## How not to change habits

* Keep warning to change habits doesn't work. Did smokers quit the smoking after warning pictures?
* Anything fails us to stop changing will make it more resilient to form habit.
* Humans are bad at processing negative information
* Thrill of gaining stuff is more motivating than fear of losing stuff, so fear doesn't work

## How to change habits

* Intervention works
  * Hand wash in hospital worked after live statistics

## What drives mind and behaviour

* Social incentive - we want to do what other people are doing (copy good behaviour)
  * We're social people: we want to know what other people are doing, we want to do the same and we want to do it better. Highlighting what other people are doing is a really strong incentive.
  * Example: Nine out of 10 people pay tax on time, helped to increase tax collection
  * We should follow what others *do*, not results.
* Immediate Reward
  * We value immediate rewards, rewards that we can get now more than rewards that we can get in the future. You're choosing something that's sure now, rather than something that's unsure in the future. Immediate rewards give us a way to bridge the temporal gap between doing an action now that is good for us in the future, until that action becomes a habit.
  * Statistics for hand wash worked
  * Why social media is very addictive?
    * Immediate reward 'likes' make it work
    * Because it gives us the immediate reward by the time we post something (‘likes’ notification) which we don’t easily get in a real social interaction.  
* Progress monitoring
  * The brain has efficient coding of positive information about the future, but is worse at processing negative information. This means that you'll want to highlight the progress people make, not the decline. (E.g. Kid smoking: If you stop smoking, you'll be better at sports.)
