* Artificial deadlines to take decisions
  * To put an end to the decision making processes, he sets a deadline for the decision to be made. Say 6pm on Monday. At five minutes to 6 he usually doesn't know the answer but in those 5 minutes something clicks, and by 6pm the answer is always there.
* 10/10/10 rule
  * How will he feel about the outcome 10 minutes from now? How about 10 months from now? How about 10 years from now?
* Doesn't matter after 'X time' 
  * If there's an important meeting with stakeholders, a scary appointment with the doctor or a tough chat with an employee - Simply keep in mind the fact that by "X time", the thing will have passed and won't matter anymore. If it doesn't matter after X time, chances are it probably doesn't matter now.
