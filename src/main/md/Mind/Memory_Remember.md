## Remembrance

* Use it or lose it.
* Tell me, I forget, teach me, I may remember, *involve* me, and I learn
* Reading technical book for awareness and mastery are different things
* Use Feynman technique to remember
* Taking handwritten notes helps, notes acts like "Chronological memory jog"
* Summarize each chapter in your own words within a single page
* Exercise MEMORY (SHORT-TERM): Repeat to remember. 
* Exercise MEMORY (LONG-TERM): Remember to repeat.
* True art of memory is attention

## Some techniques used to increase retention of technical material

1. Rewrite
   1. Forcing yourself to think about the information differently: by writing, you are doing is explaining it to yourself.
   2. The intention was never to use the note for reference, but the act of writing them enforces your memory.
2. Imagine yourselves explaining the subject to an audience.
   1. Questions would appear automatically
   2. Doing these imaginary lectures often would helps to retain for many days

* [Augmenting Long-term Memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)
* SRS, Flashcards, Testable Notes

## Memory factors
* Do you observe or see them?
* How keen your observation matters most to memory?
* Have you associated

## Why Association works?
* Spelling can be remembered using assoication
  * Piece of a pie
  * Never believe a lie

## Link method
 * Helps to remember list of items
 * Association should be ridiculous or illogical
 * Should see the picture of the word in our mind, don't see the word
----
* Example link for ridiculous & illogiacl -  Bottle & paper association (X and Y)
  * reading a giant bottle instead of paper   - use x like y
  * Writing on giantic bottle instead of paper - use y like x
  * Bottle pouring paper instead of water - y producing x or x producing y
  * Bottle mad of paper instead of glass - x made of y or y made of x


## To make illogical linking
* Gigantic or too small - Out of proportion
* With Action instead of idle
  * Violent and Embarrassing than pleasant (Human remember violent and embarrassing things longer)
* Exaggerate the number of items (in millions)
* Picturing one item instead of other (bottle made of paper)

## How to learn faster with the Feynman Technique
1. You are the easiest person to fool with, avoid it using following four steps of Feynman learning technique
2. Take a piece of paper and write the concept's name at the top.
   1. Write Pythagorean theorem
3. Explain the concept using simple language. or  Explain it to a 12-year-old. Now that you think you understand a topic reasonably well, explain it to a 12-year-old. ...
4. Identify the problem areas, then go back to the sources to review
   1. Pinpoint any complicated terms and challenge yourself to simplify them
5. You should be able to explain to others, hence try to teach to someone else

## Systematic way of reading a book - (Matt DiMaio)

1. Flip through each page of the book (without reading)
    1. Sense of how long is the chapter, anything jump out at us
1. Go to end of the each chapter
    1. Read the Quiz
    1. What author thinks you are going to learn from this book
1. Go to the begining of the chapter
   1. Read all the bold letter pring
   1. Try to anaylyze/understand the hierarchy
1. Read first and last sentence of the each paragraph
   1. First paragraph gives what the rest of the paragraph is about
   1. last sentence of paragraph sum it up
1. Above method is like top-down approach
1. Why above method works
   1. Learning requires a lot of Repetition
   1. Repetition is mother of learning
   1. Reticular activating system creates awarness

## An ancient Indian memorization technique!

1. Write target material in your own hand
   1. What you write in your own hand is easier to master
2. Read 10 times the target material right before you go to sleep (wash with cold water just before reading)
   1. Reading should be the last thing before your sleep
3. Place the material by your side - right next to your bed
4. Read 10 times the target material right after wake-up (after washing your face with cold-water)
