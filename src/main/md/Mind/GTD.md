* GTD - a trusted system for collecting tasks, ideas, and projects
  * When your system and your trust in your system is in place, subconsciousness will stop keeping track of all the things you need to do and stop constantly reminding you 
* Convert both tasks and whims into physical and visible actions
* Task List
  * In
    * As as soon as task identified, should move to In list
    * Any kind of task should go here
    * Should be accessible to log immediately, hence you can have more than one
    * First time it would take an hour to dump all kinds of task 
    * Flow: ![alt text][flow]
    * Flow: ![alt text][flow2]
	* Output: The next action needs to be a physical and visible action.    
  * Next actions (probably several – more on that later)
    * Anthing that needs to be done, soon as possible
  * Waiting for
  * Projects
    * Actions that requires than one action with next possible action

# Weekly review
  * “critical factor for success”
  * Without this, we may complete the next action of a project and forget to add a new “next action” for that project.
  * Forget to remove next actions
  * Make sure each project has at least one next action. 
  * Ensure that each action on your next actions list is actually something you want or need to do if you have the time during the coming week.
  * If not priority, move some of the next-action to some day/may be
  * Review your some day list
  * Are there any new project on your head, add to project list

# Trigger list
  * Trigger list is simply a list of key words to “trigger” your brain to remember any open loops you still haven’t captured in your system.
