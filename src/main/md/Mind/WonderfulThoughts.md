# [Sadhguru & Zakir Nair : Views on Religion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJVnPJ3LyI)
* Today religion means conflict
  * Because we reduced religion into set of beliefs
* If you want to take inward yourself, you have to transform yourself
* if you want to believe something, you don't want to transform yourself
* The moment you believe something, you will have tremendous confident
* An intelligent person is constantly hesitating with life with every step, He wonders whether what he's doing is okay or not. But a fool has absolute confidence
* It the very nature of  your intelligence is such that if you do something's too stupid today tonight your intelligence will bother you why did I do this
* if you get God's stamp on your stupidity you don't have to turn back and see. You can do grossest things on the planet and feel very proud that your anyway going to go go to heaven
* Two belief will always will have conflict, hence religion becomes problem
