So What I learnt today from a philosophical lesson.. (They are pseduo logical, and formed by strawman arguments, but some-of-them are really valid questions)

1. What is your mind?
    1. It is a collection of thoughts
    1. It is my knowledge
    1. It has past-memories/wish/anger/desire/..
    1. Reason to live in future
    1. My goal, plan, tasks, vision, and so..on
    1. very complicated..    
1. How your mind was formed to current shape?
    1. Five senses + knowledge + cosciousness + class + books + genes + habits
1. Is your mind and thoughts are same?
    1. Is your mind trusted friend or enemey?
    1. Is it deterministic?
    1. Who is controlling it?
    1. How do you know that who controls it?    
1. Can your body organs can be replaced? Yes!
    1. If you get someones' heart, do you get his meories? No!
    1. if you get somoone's blood, do you behalve like him? No!
    1. Are you this body? Yes :-)
    1. if you loose hair? have you lost you?
    1. if people lost hand/leg, did they lost themselves?
    1. Where is real "I" lives?
        1. Counter argument: where is the real onion if we keep peeling and searching "true onion inside its layers", layers is the onion
1. Which pains more?
    1. Body pain vs Mind pain?
    1. if somone beats - body is the one that feels pain
    1. but body is servant to our mind
    1. The day body couldn't help the mind, how much mind suffers? would mind prepared for it?
    1. The day mind's servant (body) doesn't respond, mind knows it was in myth about who it was.
1. If I conclude that my mind is an illusion, body is an illusion? who controls thems?
