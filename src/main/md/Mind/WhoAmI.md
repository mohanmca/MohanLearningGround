## What I learnt today from a philosophical session?

* Many of them are like pseduo-logical, and mostly formed by strawman arguments
* Still some-of-the-arguments are valid questions
* One of the Core is logic/science is not going to explain everything
* Certain question can be explained neither by philosophy, nor by science
    1. Why certain kids learn faster even at the age of 2?
    1. Why certain babies has cancer at the birth
* There won't be limit for science, neither there is going to be an end to it. At-least science can't create something from nothing. It just transforms and what is possible in nature.
