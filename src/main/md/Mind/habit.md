## Habits
* Knowing it, doing it is two different things
* Once you decided to stop, you would stop
  * Don't say last time, till next week
* Don't try to make the big change all at once
* 1% better or 1% worst is not going to impact everyday, but as time goes on this 1% small improvements or declines compound
* This 1% compound effect make huge impact on people compared with rest of the people
* Good habits are not enough, it takes only one/two small habits to hold you back.
* The only person you can compare with you is the person you were yesterday
* We can change *our world* with one step at a time
* Sometime we think so small, self-pity, envious - but that way of thinking seems small in the moment, In fact it might even make you feel better in the moment, but that way of thinking is eating away at your mental strength
* I have to work late - You give away the power
* Xyz drives me crazy - "You give away the control"
* Unhealthy beliefs about the world - "If I put in hard work, success should fall on my lap"

## Give up your bad mental habits. 
  * Mental strength is a lot like physical strength if you wanted to be physically strong, you need to go to the gym and lift weights but if you really wanted to see results you'd also have to give up eating junk food 
  * Mental strength is the same if you want to be mentally strong you need good habits like practicing gratitude.
  * But you also have to give up bad habits like resenting somebody else's success no matter how often that happens it'll hold you back.
  * Counter unhealthy mental habits with healthier habits
