## [Swami Sarvapriyananda-"Secret of Concentration" at IIT Kanpur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGswR0tMqCM)

## Conentration
* Whatever you need to achieve, you require concentration, concentration gives **richer experience**.
* The degree between ordinary and extra-ordinary person lies in degree of concentration
* Quality of life
  * Life depends on quality of experience
  * Experience depends on quality  of concentration
* We all have limited cognitive capacity
* We are 128 bit processing person
* when we use all of that 128 bit, will ignore everything else like hunger, weather, senses. Because there is no bandwidth
* 128 bit is based on book Flow, fact may vary but context remains same.
* Choose what to concentrate on, how much you want to concentrate-on.
* Milton - "The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.."
  * By choosing what to concentrate
  * By choosing how much to concentrate

## Flow requires followings
 * Requires high level of skill
 * Requires difficult activity
 * Action and awareness merging (Absorbed into the scientific work and forget about himself)
 * Clear goal should be there
 * For research, we may not have goal, but aware what goal we try to achieve
 * Feedback is required

## Natural concentration
* When you watch movie and cricket
 * We don't feel discomfort
 * Won't feel hungry
 * When you are deeply Absorbed you won't notice other senses feedback

## Vivekananda
 * Vivekananda was able to read entire volume of "Encyclopedia Britanica" and able to answer the questions
 * He also mentioned that with meditation (and concentration) and purity, anybody can do it.
 * He also symbolised Snake for concentration
 * Learn the power of detachment
 * Detachment should be practiced, detach from all the other issues.
 * Education is all about power of concentration.
* Napoleon opens the drawyer of issue and close all the other drawyer, don't worry and confuse with other drawyer

## How to improve
 * Cultivate the habit of paying fullest attention to what you are doing
 * Train the mind to concentrate, by keep concentrating
 * If we keep our mind wander, it wound wander always, it won't be good concentration
 * Read two books Flow and RAPT

## Challenges vs skills - Flow model
* Arousel (ready to face challenge) (Highest challenge, moderate skill)
* Anxiety (Highest challenge, lower than moderate skill)
* Worry (Moderate challenge, lower skill)
* Apathy (Lower challenge, lower skill)
* ---
* Boredom  (Lower challenge, moderate skill)
* Relaxation (Lower challenge, highest skill)
* Control (moderate challenge, highest skill)
* Flow (Highest skill and highest challenge)

## How does it feel to be in a Flow?
 * Completely involved in what you are doing- focused, concentrated. Even lossing other senses (hot, hungry, time)
 * A sense of ecstasy - of being outside everyday reality
 * Great inner clarity knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing (feedback)
 * A sense of serenity - no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the  ego
 * Intrinsic motivation - whatever produces flow becomes its own reward
 * Timelessness - thoroughly focused on the present, hours seem to pass by in minutes or minutes looks like years.


## Vivekananda About Goal
* Goal should have an end. Find what is the end (To complete IIT, find highest paying job in the world)
* Forget the end and focus on the means
* Keep on thinking about final goal won't help
* Clear goals are necessary for flow, without clear goals we will end up in Anxiety 

## Flow and Yoga
* Start with  right posture, sit straight. Don't lean forward like sleeping or relaxed
* Do pranayama - concentration will make breathing in both nostril, Balanced breath should be there to focus.
  * We can try with "Nadi suddhi pranayama" (In the ration of - Breath in 1 vs breath out 2)
* Arouse curiosity, setup a problem and read material so you will be curious and concentrate more.
* Avoid polluted, noisy area and try to withdraw from rest of the world.
* Focus (Dharana)
  * Be active reader, mark and do underline, place your question, write what you agree, disagree
* Stay on unbroken focus (Dhyana)

## Yoga
* Yama - Moral life
* Niyama - Discipline life
* Asana - Posture
* Pranayama - Deep breath regularly
* Prathyara - Withdrawing from world. Means literally â€œcontrol of ahara,â€� or â€œgaining mastery over external influences.â€�. Intelligent but don't struggle.
* Dharana - Focus, Concentration
* Dyana - Meditation, Unbroken focus
* Samadhi


# Quotes
* Concentration comes out of a combination of confidence and hunger
* Focusing is about saying "NO"
* Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do
* Avoid everything in general and foucs one thing in particular.
* Your goal is not to battle with the mind (distractions), but to witness the mind.


## Flow : is a function that involves Skill, Challenge and produces new state
* Flow : (Skill, Challenge) => State 
* Concentraion: directly proportionate to mental purity (uncomplicated life is also mental purity)
* Kama (pleasure (ex:partying, movie, etc), Artha (money, success, awards, promotion), we need them instinctively. But they should be regulated by Dharana (Morality)
* Pamara = [(Kama + Artha) - Moral] ~~> Produces unpleasant life
* Visayi = [(Kama + Artha) + Moral] ~~> Leads life within bounds, and laws
* Gandhi, Anna Hasare, Social Workers = [(Moksha + Dharma) - Karma - Artha ] ~~> Gives up personal gain, works for wellfare of thers.
