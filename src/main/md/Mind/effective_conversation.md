     * (Doon't express 
your opinions in a pompous and dogmatic way.)(write blog for pontification)
  * 3. Use open ended question
    *  Enter every conservation assuming you have something to learn and use who what when where and why. Let the other one describe the situation
    * If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out
    * What was it like? How do you feel?
  * 4. Go with flow, Don't stop listening. Let thoughts ebb and flow continue focusing on the conservation.
