* What comes before meditation? Concentration! Concentration comes before meditation?
* So you need to learn how to concentrate in order to meditate,
* We believe that you can't meditate if you can't concentrate
* Meditation can't change your life style! You create a lifestyle first! meditation second! Then meditation affects a lifestyle not the other way around
* if you want [to] get to know yourself you need to spend time [with] yourself
  * Within you, you ask yourself what you like? what you don't like?
  * Do you like sport xyz? do you like psychology? computer?
  * Spend time with yourself as if you are third party
