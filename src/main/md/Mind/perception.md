# Perception

## Why to learn about perception

* Do we see reality?
* You are being judged!
* What you think becomes reality!
* We judge ourselves continiously! Take a selfie and look at it for 2 minutes, or compare with 5 years old selfie.
* When we change the way we look at the things, The thing you look at change! (Dr. Wayne Dyer)
* Why we have to learn?
  * Earth was flat
  * Earth was center of universe and unmoveable
* Empathy is changing our perception like someone else (who is in trouble?), Empathy is leadership! (Satya Nadella)

## Why perception happens

* We are biologically tuned to look out for patterns, threats and oppportunities (can you see cloud/stars and without judging its patter?)
* Evolutionary theory - our ancestor pass the judgement and acrate vision via genes, hence we reconstruct than viewing as it is.
* Does natural selection favour seeing reality as it is?

## What are all components of perception

* Relativity than reality (we always judge based on relative to what next)
  * Two same color dots looks different depends on what reflects next to them

## Perceptions are good

* We can derive from partial information (people can read sentence from missing letters).
* Not seeing reality as it is, helps survival advantage (David Hoffman - Mathematical)

## How to change perceptions

* What happens if there are too many things
* What happens if we remove surrounding things - how does it reflect
* Number base can be changed, similarly we can experiment by changing the base conditions
* How can we view from different perspective, can we rotate the situation?
* How to understand better?
  * How do we share it as stories?
  * Find Analogies

## Perceptions - conclusions

* Celebrate uncertinity
* Try to enjoy both good and bad - both are just perceptions!
