# Overview
* We are a bunch of people "to form a new habit", "to quit" and learn about habit itself and obviously help each others and ourselves. We can choose one of the book like "Atomic Habits by James Clear", "Mini Habits: Smaller Habits, Bigger Results by Stephen Guise" or "Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg"

## Todo to be in the group
* Your committed to form a habit
* Practice at-least 2 minutes within a day
* Peform the same set of things, so that you could compare and improve
* Post your daily update with day-count, Your update is motivation for others, so please update.
* Appreciate others or chase others or kick others out
 
## Tips to form habit 
* We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
* The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have been formed it
* Whatever the habit, try to break it into 2 minutes task and link with existing habit
* To quit habit, try to replace with completely different habit at difference place. Observe existing cue and environments that triggers bad habit, and avoid them

## Guidelines
* Don't quote conversations from this group to outside, avoid lengthy personal conversations.
* Anyone who joins, can learn about us in first 10 days, and should commit something in next 7 days. And they should post their update everyday.
  * When we post our update, others would get reminded about their habits, In turn it helps others. It is not about boasting!
* If someone doesn't form any habit and not updating others, anyone can kick them out after first 17 days. But please drop them a gentle reminder  and note before kicking them out!
* Use Habit calendar to track and don't break the chain

# Sample committment
* Right after brusing, I would do 200 skipping
* Right after skipping, I would do 15 push-ups
* Right after push-ups, I would drink 3 glass of water
* Right after drinking, I would read financial news-paper
* Right after reading paper, I would practice singing for 2 minutes
* Right before hitting bed, I would read current affairs in French language
* Right before hitting bed, I would read book and improve vocabulary
* Right after using washroom, I would do plank for 2 minutes

# Sign of not-appropriate committments
* Right after brushing, I would complete a chapter  from machine learning book (doesn't fit within 2 minute)
* Can you minimize your habit to 2 minute? (Example: I am a vegetarian for whole week)
* I would learn python everyday (what is minified version of your commitment?)
