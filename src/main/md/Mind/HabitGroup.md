# Overview
* We are a bunch of people "to form a new habit", "to quit" and learn about habit itself and obviously help each others and ourselves. We can choose one of the book like "Atomic Habits by James Clear", "Mini Habits: Smaller Habits, Bigger Results by Stephen Guise" or "Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg"

## Todo to be in the group
* You should commit to form a habit. Break that habit such that atleast you can do for 2 minutes within a day
* Post every-day update
* Appreciate others or chase others or kick others out 
 
## Tips to form habit 
* We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
* The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have been formed it
* Whatever the habit, try to break it into 2 minutes task and link with existing habit
* To quit habit, try to replace with completely different habit at difference place. Avoid existing cue and environments

## Guidelines
* Don't quote this conversation outside, and avoid length personal conversation.
* Anyone who joins can learn about us in first 10 days, and should commit something in next 7 days. And they should keep post their update everyday.
  * When we post our update, others would get reminded about their habit, That would help others.
* If someone doesn't form any habit and not updating others, anyone can kick them out after first 17 days.
* Use Habit calendar to track and not break the chain
