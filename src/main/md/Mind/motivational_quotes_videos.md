## How to keep cool? (Answered by Dhoni)
```
Don't think about the result.  It is the result that puts the preassure on us.
What if this happens?
What if we don't win the game?
What if we don't selected?

Worry (Think) about the controlables
Whatever the controlables that we take care of it, we will get the desired result.
If we don't get the desired result, we will improve. We will change our plans, we will execute better.
We will get a chance to prove again.
Thinking about the result never gives you the result.
You can have target in mind, but what is more important to take care the small steps in life.
What needs to be done?
What I am supposed to do?
What extra I can do?
That will help us to achieve the target!

The legend!

## From Autobiography of Yogi
* Sri Yuketshwar public speeches emphasized the value of Kriya Yoga, and a life of self-respect, calmness, determination, simple diet, and regular exercise.*
Look fear in the face and it will cease to trouble you. - Sri Yuketshwar

He is a fool that cannot conceal his wisdom
Disbelieve in the reality of sickness even when you are ill; an unrecognized visitor will flee! - Sri Yukteswar
Good manners without sincerity are like a beautiful dead lady - Sri Yukteswar
“Straightforwardness without civility is like a surgeon’s knife, effective but unpleasant. Candor with courtesy is helpful and admirable.”  - Sri Yukteswar
Inwardly humble and outwardly unbendable - Sri Yukteswar
“Softer than the flower, where kindness is concerned; stronger than the thunder, where principles are at stake.” - Sri Yukteswar
As soon as the devotee is willing to go even to the ends of the earth for spiritual enlightenment, his guru appears near-by.
By a number of means—by prayer, by will power, by yoga meditation, by consultation with saints, by use of astrological bangles—the adverse effects of past wrongs can be minimized or nullified.

## Advices
* “Destroy wrong desires now; otherwise they will follow you after the astral body is torn from its physical casing. Even when the flesh is weak, the mind should be constantly resistant. If temptation assails you with cruel force, overcome it by impersonal analysis and indomitable will. Every natural passion can be mastered."
