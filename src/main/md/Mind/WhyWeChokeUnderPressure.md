## What is choking?

1. Performing poorer than ability of the person

## [What I learnt from Sports - India Vs Bangladesh T20 Nidas Trophy Final 2018|Last Over Full Thriller Match](|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njqnq3d6rz8)

* Ref: India Vs Pakistan T20 world cup 2007 super over win the match
* I watch plenty of cricket, but what recently observed is successful sportsperson should have two qualities
    * Skill + Keeping Cool
* With only skill, Pakistan bowlers would have won the game. They are known as best skill-full bowlers
* With only skill, DK would have been successful in many other occasions, but he also increases skill + attitude
* Similarly, Dhoni is known as wonderful cricketer, but definitely not the best among top batters, but he achieved by keeping himself cool on many occasion
* Similarly, Zidaine would have won the game for France, but he lost his coolness, due to famous headbut he failed the team. But skill-wise he is legend
* How to keep ourselves calm regardless of situation is the key
    * We should practice being calm
    * Daily Meditation, Keeping us fit and Breathe exercise
    * Let go of any grudges and judgments, don't take it personally, don't judge that moment
    * Look at the situation as it truly is. If it is nervous for us, it could be nervous for others who create such a situation. Think from others perspective. Find the unseen gifts in the situation.
    * Determine your desired outcome, but on work and task don't think about it often, rather focus on process.
    * Remove yourself from the situation
    * Positive Self-Talk, self suggestion
* Additional observation from my friend
    * If Pakistan had started bowling, India might have lost, sometime opportunity luck matters
    * Not trusting their regular style of bowling is crazy, when under pressure use your time tested technique
    * Never forget to practice the basics (here basic bowling to hit stick was forgotten by experienced bowler)
    * Little of careless attitude helps when under pressure
    * Being in similar situation using simulation or experience or anticipated practice would helps

## How to train?

1. Don't think just do it
2. Practice as much as you can
3. Can't find anyone to listen do it in front of mirror or camera
4. Write down your thoughts and worries in a paper just before the situation
5. Make a comfortable environment
6. Overcome your fear

## Alternative mind-set
1. "If your goal is to win, you're already at a disadvantage". You must convince your mind that the task at hand is as important as tying your shoelaces.
2. If the only outcome that we expect is win, we do not have common sense
3. 

## How to practice (inorder not to choke under pressure)

1. Continuously Re-evaluate the negative situations, it would continuously help to improve
2. What are you going to change next-time (which you did not do well this time)
3. We have to train our mind to calm given the situation
4. Practice taking actual test
5. Bring the situation under control
   1. Getting out of control of the situation should not be an option!
6. Keep practicing a Mantra
   1. It would help to move on (at-least Mantra would move on when you are stuck)
   2. Mantra may help you to get out of focusing too much of details to where you need to go
7. Do what we have to do in high pressure situation
8. Do it under the time limit and people around you
9. Video and Audio tape yourself to find how you perform
10. Palm sweaty and high heart beat is sign of fear and failure.. it is also sign of huge success and something great happened
11. Talk to yourself, Self compassion, patient and perseverance
12. Stop yourself throwing down (realize, be calm)
13. They would become automatic, hence we don't need to put effort in future
14. Writing a journal would help to recover and reinterpret a thought
