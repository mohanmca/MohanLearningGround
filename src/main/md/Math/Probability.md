* Probability is not always intuitive
* Probability is a mathematical description of randomness and uncertainty. It is a way to measure or quantify uncertainty.
* Probability is the underlying foundation for the methods of statistical inference.  Probability can be used to quantify how much we expect random samples (collected as part of statistics) to vary.
* Probability can answer the question like "How likely is it that our sample estimate is no more than 3% from the true percentage of all U.S. adults who are in favor of the death penalty?”

* Volunteer sample - is biased
  * Determine the musical preferences of all students at your university, and assuming it is entire population
  * We cannot generalize to any larger group at all.
  * Volunteer samples tend to be comprised of individuals who have a particularly strong opinion about an issue, and are looking for an opportunity to voice it.
* Convenience sample - is biased
  * Stand outside the Student Union, across from the Fine Arts Building, and ask students passing by to respond to your question about musical preference.
  * Checking only music students is not entire population
* Sampling frame - biased
  * Ask your professors for email rosters of all the students in your classes. Randomly sample some addresses, and email those students with your question about musical preference.  
  * list of potential individuals to be sampled—does not match the population of interest.
* Systematic sampling - Unbiased - Not subject to any bias
  * Obtain a student directory with email addresses of all the university's students, and send the music poll to every 50th name on the list.
  * If individuals are sampled completely at random, and without replacement, then each group of a given size is just as likely to be selected as all the other groups of that size. This is called a simple random sample (SRS).

* Probability sampling plan (or technique)
  * Simple Random Sampling 
  * Cluster Sampling
    * Suppose that the city has 10 hospitals. Choose one of the 10 hospitals at random and interview all the nurses in that hospital regarding their job satisfaction. This is an example of cluster sampling, in which the hospitals are the clusters.
  * Stratified Sampling
    * Choose a random sample of 50 nurses from each of the 10 hospitals and interview these 50 * 10 = 500 regarding their job satisfaction. This is an example of stratified sampling, in which each hospital is a stratum.

* Aleatory vs Epistemic (errors)
