* Statistics is concerned with scientific method for collecting, organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing and interpreting of data. The word statistics is normally referred either as numerical facts or methods.
* Example usages
  * number of accidents in a busy road of a city in a day
  * number of people died due to a chronic disease during a month in a state
  * Actuarial science is the discipline that extensively applies statistical methods among other subjects involved in insurance and financial institutions.
  * Ttests of significance and confidence intervals are heavily used in Medical field
* Statistical subdomain
  * Probability Theory, 
  * Sampling Theory, 
  * Statistical Inference, 
  * Design of Experiments, 
  * Correlation and Regression Methods
  * Time Series and Forecasting Techniques.
* Functions of Statistics
  * Collection
  * Classification
  * Condensation
  * Comparison
  * Correlation
  * Causation.
  * Chance
* Two major divisions of statistical methods - Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics


*Quantitative* - A variable is said to be quantitative if it is measurable and can be expressed in specific units of measurement (numbers).
*Qualitative* -  A variable is said to be qualitative if it is not measurable and cannot be expressed in specific units of measurement (numbers). This variable is also called categorical variable. Example: Blood Type, Sex, Race, Religion
*Measurement Scales* - Ordinal, Nominal, Ratio and Interval (ONRI)
* Ordinal - 1/0, Male of Female
* Nominal - (1) Very unhappy (2) Unhappy (3) Okay (4) Happy (5) Very happy.  (what is the difference between Okay and Happy?)
* Interval - 60 degree to 70 degree, 70 degree to 80 degree
  * it does not mean that an object with temperature 120c is twice as hot as an object with temperature 60c (convert from F to C and compare)
  * There may not be absolute zero (shouldn't confused with relative zero)
* Ratio - Height and Weight.
  * Used for both descriptive and inferential statistics
  * These variables can be meaningfully added, subtracted, multiplied, divided). 
  * Central tendency can be measured by mean, median, or mode; Measures of dispersion, such as standard deviation and coefficient of variation can also be calculated from ratio scales.


* “One death is a tragedy; a million is a statistics.”


* Gauss introduced the theory of errors in physical sciences at the end of eighteenth century.
