## Design sampling

* Prospective vs Retrospective Study
* Experiments vs. Observational Studies
* The most reliable way to determine whether the explanatory variable is actually causing changes in the response variable is to carry out a randomized controlled double-blind experiment.
  * If neither the subjects nor the researchers know who was assigned what treatment, then the experiment is called double-blind.


## Observational studies:
* The explanatory variable's values are allowed to occur naturally.
* Because of the possibility of lurking variables, it is difficult to establish causation.
* If possible, control for suspected lurking variables by studying groups of similar individuals separately.
* Some lurking variables are difficult to control for; others may not be identified.

## Experiments

* The explanatory variable's values are controlled by researchers (treatment is imposed).
* Randomized assignment to treatments automatically controls for all lurking variables.
* Making subjects blind avoids the placebo effect.
* Making researchers blind avoids conscious or subconscious influences on their subjective assessment of responses.
* A randomized controlled double-blind experiment is generally optimal for establishing causation.
* A lack of realism may prevent researchers from generalizing experimental results to real-life situations.
* Noncompliance may undermine an experiment. A volunteer sample might solve (at least partially) this problem.
* It is impossible, impractical or unethical to impose some treatments.

## Survey checklist
* A sample survey is a type of observational study in which respondents assess variables' values (often by giving an opinion).
* Open questions are less restrictive, but responses are more difficult to summarize.
* Closed questions may be biased by the options provided.
* Closed questions should permit options such as "other:______" and/or "not sure" if those options may apply.
* Questions should be worded neutrally.
* Earlier questions should not deliberately influence responses to later questions.
* Questions shouldn't be confusing or complicated.
* Survey method and questions should be carefully designed to elicit honest responses if there are sensitive issues involved.
* There should be equal number of favoural and un-favourable questions with neutral option


For the question, "Have you used illegal drugs in the past year?" 
* If respondents answer no, then it is still a possibility that they did use illegal drugs, but didn't want to admit it.
* Respondents are told to flip a fair coin (in private) before answering and then answer based on the result of the coin flip: if the coin flip results in "Heads," they should answer "Yes" (regardless of the truth), if a coin flip results in "Tails," they should answer truthfully. Thus, roughly half of the respondents are "truth-tellers," and the other half give the uncomfortable answer "Yes," without the interviewer's knowledge of who is in which group. The respondent who flips "Tails" and answers truthfully knows that he or she cannot be distinguished from someone who got "Heads" in the coin toss. Hopefully, this is enough to encourage respondents to answer truthfully. As we will learn later in the course, the surveyor can then use probability methods to estimate the proportion of respondents who admit they used illegal drugs in this scenario, while being unable to identify exactly which respondents have been drug abusers.
