* Game Theory
  * Person's action depends on what others do or expected to do
  * How people act when they are interconnected
  * Strategic interaction
  * Coperation vs Conflict
  * Our action impacts others, and other's action impacts ours
 * FT - Number guess game
   * Reader picks a number zero and 100, winner is a contestant with a number closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers entered in the contest
   * Guessing game proves that there would be bubble even if everyone is rational   
 * Application
   * Politics - Policy of rival party
   * Economics - Pricing of rival firm, and competition, competitors product
   * Biology - fighting for scarce resource aggresively, but not with powerful one
* Application
  * Simultaneous moves
  * Strategic interactions
  * Payoff matrix
* Payoff
  * Maximize happiness
  * Maximize harm (competition)
* Nash equilibrium
  * Each player does the best response possible to the choice of the other player
  * Rational expectations
  * Prisoner's dillema
    * car theft and Hit and Run
    * 1 x 1, 10 x 10 (both silent, both confess)  
    * 0 x 15, 15 x 0 (a confess and b guilty, b confesses and a guilty)
  * For above pay off, both prisonars confesses
  * Pareto efficiency
* Pareto efficiency
  * Pareto efficiency couldn't be trusted when nuclear arm race happens between super power
  * If nuclear weapon will not be used, better without producing them, but requires to dominant power
* Co-operative nash equilibrium
  * Ash and Beth are room mate, both are not ready to doing dishes, both wants other to do the dish (do/clean dish)
  * Pay off
  * A:10, B:10, A:20, B: 08 (Neither does, Alice does the dish)  
  * A:08, B:20, A:14, B: 14 (Beth does, Both does)
  * Here equilibrium is both does the dish  
* Multiple nash equilibrium
  * Amy and Bob like to *stay together*, in an event.
  * (A:5*B:10, A:10*B:5) - Foot ball vs Dance
  * For them staying together is more important.
  * Assume they can't contact each other, If they need to make simultaneous move, there are two possibilities.
  * Each would think others convenient and yield for others interest, It might leads to co-ordination failure
  * When multiple-equilibrium, to avoid co-ordination failure, we can choose to use "Soical norm" or co-ordination device
  * Every time when co-ordiantion failure occurs between Bob & Amy, They choose Bob way, that is norm for them. It avoids co-ordination failure.  
  * Or rely on first advertisement on radio between 4~5 (Co-ordination device)
  
   
* Focual point effect
  * Culture and history can affect our rational behaviour
  * Co-ordination device
  * self-fulfilling expectations  - Expectations which induce people to take actions which bring about the situation that is expected.
    * When everyone tries to withadraw all of their money from bank, bank run would happen. They would run out of money
  * Positive statements or actions by bankers or policymakers can backfire if people take them as sign of weakness
* Mixed-stratgey nash equilibrium
  *  rock, paper and scissors
  * "Black Wednesday" - "16/09/1992" - pound collapsed
  * George soros made billions
  * Speculators randomize the timing of the attack (short-sell), if central bank tried to buy mark, it gave clue to short-sellers
* Expected profit and war of attrition
  * If two store operating in the same smallville, only one has to survive, who stays long would wins
  * if the expected profit between two option, one option is higher business would do that, if not, they can choose any of the two  
* Evolutionary biology
  * Hawk vs Dove
  * Individual success and group failure
  * Largest fish keep growing, but it has to fight with similar large fish, and evoultion would destry weakest among them and stronger would survive
  * Two agressive lion confronts and creates damage among them
  * Dove type vs Hawk Type (Hawk type always wins)
  * Mathematically the two problems, the rational decision makers and and the problem of genetically conditioned animals subject to evoultionary forces are identical
* Sequential move games
  * An entrepreneur opening a coffee shop in a corner place can observe which other shops are already there, and will consider which other may come
  * Are there first mover advantage?
  * Subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium
  * Game tree expected payoff
  * time inconsistency problem - In economics, dynamic inconsistency or time inconsistency is a situation in which a decision-maker's preferences change over time in such a way that a preference can become inconsistent at another point in time.
    * My boss was accused of time inconsistency when he initially told us he wanted us to purchase our competitor, but then backtracked when the sale was about to go through.
  * Commitment device - Collect collateral to elliminate time inconsistencies (Bank collects collateral, so that entrepreneur invests in safe project, and doesn't invest in risky projects)
  * Commitment device doesn't work for poor - Grameen bank, microcredit for poor, Muhammed Yunus
  * In nuclear war, how to enforce retaliation
    * One leader initiate
    * Delegate to multiple leaders to initiate retaliation
    * Automate retaliation
  * Doomsday device would automatically retaliate, but its purpose is not-to-initiate initial strike by opponent, The day we use, it alerady failed its purpose
* Incomplete information
  * Asymmetric information
  * Insurance companies work with asymmetric information. Car insurer knows how he drives, not insurance company
  * Persistent employment
  * hidden action - Most poor people earn more than minimum wage when they are working; their problem is not low wages.  The problem comes when they are not working. - Joseph Stiglitz
  * Warranties are trying to remove asymmetric information about quality before trying
  * High level of advertising only be profitable for companies with high quality product
    * Low quality with advertising - no repeat customers.
    * High quality with advertising - repeat customers.
  * Religious rituals are there to ensure "people are true believers" not pretending to get short term benefit
  * Even team players are rational, team could be irrational
  * Rational decision makers have transitive preference (A>B, B>C, i.e, A >C)
  * for team even if (A>B, B>C), still A < C, because team is irrational and non-transitive
  * Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem - Without dictator group would always make bad choice
  * If citi council has to choose one among three (Park > Recycling > School), They would choose wrong, one despire everyone independently vote something irrational 
  * Attempts to form social judgement by aggregating individual expressed preference always lead to the possibility of paradox
  * In battle, if a soldier thinks they would win, and he assumes his actions are not matter, and fellow soldier believe they are going to loose... in-coperative army would loose
