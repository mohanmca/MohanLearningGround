* Game Theory
  * Person's action depends on what others do or expected to do
  * How people act when they are interconnected
  * Strategic interaction
  * Coperation vs Conflict

 * FT - Number guess game
   * Reader picks a number zero and 100, winner is a contestant with a number closest to 2/3 of the average of all numbers entered in the contest
   * Guessing game proves that there would be bubble even if everyone is rational   
 * Application
   * Politics - Policy of rival party
   * Economics - Pricing of rival firm, and competition, competitors product
   * Biology - fighting for scarce resource aggresively, but not with powerful one
* Application
  * Simultaneous moves
  * Strategic interactions
  * Payoff matrix
* Payoff
  * Maximize happiness
  * Maximize harm (competition)
* Nash equilibrium
  * Each player does the best response possible to the choice of the other player
  * Rational expectations
  * Prisoner's dillema
    * car theft and Hit and Run
    * 1 x 1, 10 x 10 (both silent, both confess)  
    * 0 x 15, 15 x 0 (a confess and b guilty, b confesses and a guilty)
  * For above pay off, both prisonars confesses
  * Pareto efficiency
* Pareto efficiency
  * Pareto efficiency couldn't be trusted when nuclear arm race happens between super power
  * If nuclear weapon will not be used, better without producing them, but requires to dominant power
