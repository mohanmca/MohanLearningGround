To Summarize
1. In hypothesis testing for the population mean (μ), we distinguish between two cases:
  I. The less common case when the population standard deviation (σ) is known.
  II. The more practical case when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample standard deviation (s) is used instead.
2. In the case when σ is known, the test for μ is called the z-test, and in case when σ is unknown and s is used instead, the test is called the t-test.
3. In both cases, the null hypothesis is: 
H0 : μ =μ0
and the alternative, depending on the context, is one of the following:
Ha : μ < μ0, or Ha : μ>μ0, or Ha: μ ≠ μ0
4. Both tests can be safely used as long as the following two conditions are met:
(i) The sample is random (or can at least be considered random in context).
(ii) Either the sample size is large (n > 30) or, if not, the variable of interest can be assumed to vary normally in the population.

5. In the z-test, the test statistic is: 
z=
¯¯¯
(X − μ0) /(σ/√n)

whose null distribution is the standard normal distribution (under which the p-values are calculated).

6. In the t-test, the test statistic is:
t =
¯¯¯
(X − μ0)/ (s/√n)

whose null distribution is t(n - 1) (under which the p-values are calculated).

7. For large sample sizes, the z-test is a good approximation for the t-test.

8. Confidence intervals can be used to carry out the two-sided test
H_0: μ = μ_0 
vs. 
Ha :μ≠μ0 , and in cases where Ho is rejected, the confidence interval can give insight into the value of the population mean (μ).
