## Steps of thinking..

1. If everyone chooses 100, then 2/3 of average should be 66. Hence anyone who guessed above are not rational
2. First level thinker, is rational and preassumes guess number is normally distributed, then average is 50. Two third of it is 33.
3. Second level thinker, preassumes that there exists multiple first level thinker, then average is 22 (2/3 of 33).
4. Third level thinker, preassumes that there exists multiple second level thinker, then average is 14 (2/3 of 22).
4. Nth level thinker, who knew nash equvilibrium thinks  average is 0 (2/3 of 0.0000x).



# What does it prove?

* Simplicity can often be the biggest source of confusion
* Anyone who guessed above 66 are not rational `this time` or just completed smoking marijuna
* Being smart isn’t enough
  * We need to be smart enough to understand and account for other people’s shortcomings, and this is crucial in betting.
  * Other people shortcomings are good, it undercuts some people trying to be over-smart
* Being rational alone isn't enough
