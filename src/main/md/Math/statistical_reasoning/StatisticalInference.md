* Value of population proportion, based on an observed sample proportion. This process—inferring something about the population based on what is measured in the sample—is (as you know) called statistical inference.

* "We are 95% confident that the sample mean x(par) falls within 3 units of μ population-mean" (Language of probability)
* "We are 95% confident that the population mean μ falls within 3 units of aritmetic-mean of statistics x(bar)"  (Language of statistics)

* There is a trade-off between the level of confidence and the precision with which the parameter is estimated.
* Higher the confidence tends to lower precision
* The same level of confidence (95%) with narrower precision is possible by increasing sample-size.
* On an intuitive level, if our estimate x^ is based on a larger sample (i.e., a larger fraction of the population), we have more faith in it, or it is more reliable, and therefore we need to account for less error around it.
