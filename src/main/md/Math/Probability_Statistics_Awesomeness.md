## The Birthday Problem


## The Birthday Problem
* In a hall of 60 people what is the probability of 2 people's birthday to be same.
* P + P` = 1
* Let us assume 365 days
* Number of links between 60 people, (60 * 59)/2 = 3538 combination of birthdays
* Let us assume 60-th person's birth day is X
* Let us assume 59th person birthday not to be X = 364/365 = 0.99
* Let us assume 58th person birthday not to be X = 363/365 = 0.98
