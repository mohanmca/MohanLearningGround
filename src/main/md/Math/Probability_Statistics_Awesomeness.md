## The Birthday Problem


## The Birthday Problem
* In a hall of 60 people what is the probability of 2 people's birthday to be same. = 99.995%
* P + P` = 1
* Let us assume 365 days
* Number of links between 60 people, (60 * 59)/2 = 3538 combination of birthdays
* Let us assume 60-th person's birth day is X
* Let us assume 59th person birthday not to be X = 364/365 = 0.997260274
* Let us assume 58th person birthday not to be X = 363/365 = 0.994520548
* Let us assume 1stth person birthday not to be X = 363/365 = 0.835616438
* Producut of all the above probablity (that no two person birthday matches) = 0.997 * 0.994 * .. * 0.8356 = 0.004911201
* 1 - above= 1 - 0.004911201 = 99.9950888
* The probability that a continuous random variable equals some value is always zero.
