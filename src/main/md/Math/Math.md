* If a and b are the probabilities associated with two independent pieces of evidence, then combined they indicate a probability of:

```
       ab
-------------------
  ab + (1 - a)(1 - b)
  
            abc           
---------------------------
abc + (1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) 
```
* 7 feet tall indicates with 60% probability that someone is a basketball player, and carrying a basketball indicates this with 72% probability. If you see someone who is over 7 feet tall and carrying a basketball, what is the probability that they're a basketball player?

  * 
```  
           (.60)(.72)
    ------------------------------- = 0.794 = 79.5%
    (.60)(.72) + (1 - .60)(1 - .72)
```
