* Stem plot
* Quantitative variable is described by its shape, center, and spread. 
* IQR = Q3 - Q1
* An observation is considered a suspected outlier if it is:
  * Below Q1 - 1.5(IQR)
  * Above Q3 + 1.5(IQR)
* The combination of all five numbers (min, Q1, M, Q3, Max) is called the five number summary,
* Standard deviation
  * One with biasness
  * Bessel's Correction SD is without biasness
* The Standard Deviation Rule
  * Also known as empirical rule
  * 68, 95, 99.7 - Area under different standard deviation
  * If SD is zero, data in the problem in unifrom, no deviation
  * The standard deviation measures the spread by reporting a typical (average) distance between the data points and their average.
  * Mean, SD should be used for symmetric data.

* When creating a scatterplot, the explanatory variable should always be plotted on the horizontal X-axis
* Scaterplot patterns
  * +Positive   
  * -Negatives
  * V-Shape (Neither +ve, nor -Ve) or (Half +ve and Half -ve)
    *  The average fuel usage of driving a fixed distance in a car, and the speed at which the car drives:
  * Curve linear
  * Cluster
  * Strong or Weak relationship
  * Can find "diminishing returns"

* Linear relationship
  * Strength of a linear relationship - Correlation coefficient and is denoted by r.
  * R ranges from -1 to +1
  * Negative relationship -1, Positive relationship +1, No relationship 0
  * +Ve would produce Scaterplot patterns positive


* Four kinds of co-relation
  * C-Q
  * C-C
  * Q-C
  * Q-C  

* Co-relation
  * We use the terms explanatory and response variables instead of independent and dependent variables.
