* Stem plot
* Quantitative variable is described by its shape, center, and spread. 
* IQR = Q3 - Q1
* An observation is considered a suspected outlier if it is:
  * Below Q1 - 1.5(IQR)
  * Above Q3 + 1.5(IQR)
* The combination of all five numbers (min, Q1, M, Q3, Max) is called the five number summary,
* Standard deviation
  * One with biasness
  * Bessel's Correction SD is without biasness
* The Standard Deviation Rule
  * Also known as empirical rule
  * 68, 95, 99.7 - Area under different standard deviation
  * If SD is zero, data in the problem in unifrom, no deviation
  * The standard deviation measures the spread by reporting a typical (average) distance between the data points and their average.
  * Mean, SD should be used for symmetric data.
* Four kinds of co-relation
  * C-Q
  * C-C
  * Q-C
  * Q-C  

* Co-relation
  * We use the terms explanatory and response variables instead of independent and dependent variables.
