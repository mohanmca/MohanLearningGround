* Salary is also based on location, and "demand and supply"
* Average developer in niche programming (Haskell/Scala/F#) paid higer, because there are simply fewer of them
* Salary is in direct correlation to your expertise and knowledge how to solve (particular) problems and achieve business goals
* People are paid according to how replaceable they are
* A programmer wants to judge himself/herself by a single language then they're already replaceable
* Being subject-matter expert in a area where industry has highest demand would be a boon. (Ex: Machine learning expert in 2015~2027)

# Pay Negotiations
* What would it take for me to earn a raise in the future?
* Rather than directly asking for more money, Pose the question about where I fell in the spectrum of other workers?

# Against Counter Offer
* Between 75% to 90% of people who accept a counteroffer leave the company within a year anyway (source???)
* The circumstances that caused you to look in the first place will not change if you take a counteroffer, the circumstances will just repeat in the future.

# To Counter Offer
* Recruiters NEVER benefit from an accepted counteroffer.
