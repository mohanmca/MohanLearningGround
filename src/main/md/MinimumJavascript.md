# The Minimum Javascript you should know when you code reactjs & redux

* '10' + 20 ~~> 1020
* 'truthy' is if non boolean value converts to true
* 'falsy' is if non boolean value converts to false
* !! 'double exclamation' can be used to find if a value is truthy or falsy
  * !!{}
  * !!0
  * !![]
* Short circuit operator
  * console.log(test && test.toPrint)
* *  
 
 
# feedbacks
*  @10,@11 rather naming test and test2, name the function as nullPrinter and stuffPrinter
*  showing whereto use short-circuit in reactjs is ++
* @14, Object.freeze and enum pattern would have been better.
* @17, it should be "VM231:7 Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined"
* R.partialRight was wow! never used
* @24 there is a typo, it should be x instead of X, and reduce may not require explicit 0. (but explici passing considered good!)
* @26 was it poop, shit! nice pun!
* @26 - there are two the, sounds wrong to return the just the names of the"..
* once you encourage let, why do you fallback to var in 26
* @35 - iPhone-7 has 2gb ram instead of 3gb 
* @43 - `latest` addition? will it make sense 3 years from now?, I have been using more than 2 years.
* @48 - What is commonJs? No background...
* Just a note: Ommitting "js" while importing considered bad design.
* @51 - file1.js and file2.js, common Tomy, you could do cooler :)
* @57 - that quiz question was not clear.
