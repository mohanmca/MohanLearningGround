* BDD focuses on the USERsâ€™ opinion on how they want your application to behave, TDD focuses on the DEVELOPER's opinion on how parts of the software should work 
* BDD is concerned primarily with the specification of the behavior of the system under test as a whole, thus is particularly suited for acceptance and regression testing.
* Business and Technology should use common domain language, Hence BDD should talk the language of the business domain
* Every test case in BDD should identify, validate value to the business of a system under test 
* TDD => Red, Green and Refactor
   * Red - Write a test that fails
   * Green - Make the code work
   * Refactor - Eliminate redundancy
* BDD should consider specification of behaviour of system than writing tests
