* BDD is concerned primarily with the specification of the behavior of the system under test as a whole, thus is particularly suited for acceptance and regression testing.
* Business and Technology should use common domain language, Hence BDD should talk the language of the business domain
* Every test case in BDD should identify, validate value to the business of a system under test

   * Green - Make the code work
   * Refactor - Eliminate redundancy
* BDD should consider specification of behaviour of system than writing tests
