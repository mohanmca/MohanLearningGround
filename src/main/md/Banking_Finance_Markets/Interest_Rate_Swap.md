## Interest Rate Swaps
1. What is a swap?
    1. A swap is a derivative instrument involving the exchange of a series of future cash flows between two parties over a period of time.
    2. This contract has offsetting obligations – each party pays a series of cash flows at various future dates while receiving another series of cash flows in exchange.
    3. Fixed 2% vs SOFR-50bps
2. Key characteristics of swap contracts
3. Importance of netting and compression of swap trades for bank regulatory swap requirements
4. Types of SWAPS
   1. IRS
   2. Equity index swap
   3. CDS (protection buyer and seller)


## 4 components of SWAP
1. A notional principal amount.
2. Total contract time
3. Fixed rate vs floating rate
4. Counter parties (legal entities)
*. Example swap
   1. Under a five-year interest rate swap with a notional principal of USD 100 million.
   2. Counterparty A agrees to pay Counterparty B a series of fixed interest payments, set at 2% per annum, paid semiannually. 
   3. In exchange, Counterparty B agrees to make a series of payments to Counterparty A based on a benchmark interest rate plus a spread of 50 basis points.

## Famous floating rate and conventions
1. SOFR - floating, or variable rate.
2. By IRS convention, in a fixed-for-floating IRS, the receiver is receiving fixed and by implication paying floating.
   1. IRS, no notational amount exchanged
   2. CCX, Cross currency swap, principal amounts are exchanged to reduce the fx-risk
3. Why replicate an IRS with futures contracts?
   1. Lesser regulatory capital with listed futures

## Notional value
1. The notional principal of a swap is either constant through the life of the swap 
2. Or else may reduce (for an amortizing swap).
3. Increase (for an accreting swap) according to a pre-agreed schedule. 
4. Notional principal amounts do not change as a function of interest rate levels.

## NETTING & COMPRESSION: EXAMPLE
1. Large first has back-to-back IRS deals on their book
2. Better to compress them into few
3. Noncleared OTC swaps attract regulatory capital requirements that could be reduced by compressing the trades.
4. Selling protection in a CDS effectively means taking on the credit risk associated with the reference obligation – this is closest to being long a credit risky bond.

## OIS - reference indices
1. SOFR in US dollars
2. €STR in euro,
3. and SONIA in sterling

## What to learn?
1. Discount curve
2. Swap's index curve
3. Why there has been a convergence between swap and futures markets?
4. CDS - Impact of buying and selling it
   1. Selling protection in a CDS effectively means taking on the credit risk associated with the reference obligation.
   2. This is closest to being long a credit risky bond.
