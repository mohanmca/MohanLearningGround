## What is Mark Price
* Mark price is a reference price used in derivatives markets
* It is designed to prevent market manipulation and ensure that the contract's trading price closely tracks the underlying asset's spot price.
* The mark price is calculated using a weighted average of the recent trading prices on the exchange or multiple exchanges, depending on the specific platform.

## Funding rate
* One primary purpose of the mark price is to determine the funding rate in perpetual swap contracts.
* The funding rate is a mechanism used to align the contract's price with the underlying spot market.
* If the contract is trading at a premium to the mark price, long positions pay a funding fee to short positions, and vice versa.
* This mechanism helps prevent significant divergences between the contract price and the spot price.
