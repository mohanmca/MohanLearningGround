## [What is Athena](https://anton.io/i_work_for_jp_morgan_chase/)

```text
“Athena is J.P. Morgan’s cross-market risk management and trading system. It is currently used in our foreign exchange and commodities businesses, and is being rolled out more broadly across our fixed income businesses. Athena includes a globally replicated object-oriented database, a powerful dependency graph and a fully integrated stack across pricing, risk and trading tools. The code is a combination of Python, C++, and Java: C++ and Java for speed, and Python for flexibility and rapid but controlled releases. Athena is designed to pull developers close to the business to help increase revenues while improving operational processes and controls to reduce costs.” – J.P. Morgan Chase.
