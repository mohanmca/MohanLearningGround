## 100000 invested 3.5% for 10- years
1. FV = USD 100,000 × (1 + r)<sup>n</sup> = USD 100,000 × 1.035<sup>10</sup>  = USD 141,059.88
2. This represents a cumulative return of 41.06%.
3. If 150000 is expected from 100K, then either IR should be higher or time should be longer
   1. R = ln(USD 150,000 / USD 100,000) / ln(1.035)
   2. 0.4054651 / 0.0344014 = 11.79 years

## To achieve 150K, what is the IR required
1. R = (FV/PV)<sup>1/n</sup> – 1
2. = (USD 150,000 / USD 100,000)<sup>1/10</sup> – 1
3. = 4.14% (rounded)

## PV of zero coupon bond
1. The PV of a zero coupon bond is:
2. PV = CF/(1 + r)<sup>N</sup> = USD 150,000 /c
   1. = USD 150,000 / (1.06<sup>7</sup>)
   2. = USD 99,758.57
   3. CF = compounding frequency
