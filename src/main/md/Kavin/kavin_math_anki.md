## What is the example of Remainder Concept (Branching)?

## What is the example of "Equal Fractions Concept"?
1. There are 836 students in a school. 7/10 of the boys and 7/8 of the girls take bus to school. The number of boys who do not take bus is twice the number of girls who do not take bus. How many girls do not take bus?


## More Than, Less Than, As Many As
1. [James had 120 more marbles than Dan. After James lost 1/5 of his marbles and Dan lost 3/4 of his marbles, James had 184 more marbles than Dan. How many marbles did Dan have at first?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKfVpVF-yMw)
1. Felicia and Julia had some pink and yellow beads. Felicia had 100 more beads than Julia. The number of pink beads that she had was 25 more than the number of pink beads than Julia had. Julia had 68 more yellow beads than pink beads. How many more yellow than pink beads did Felicia have?

## Constant Part Concept -n Ration Question
1. The word “Constant” means remain the same. You need to identify the part which remain constant and make them equal in both ratios. 
1. Ali and Billy have money in the ratio of 5 : 6. After Billy spent $16, the ratio became 3 : 2. How much money does Billy have in the end?

## Constant Total Concept
1. Under questions which involve “Internal Transfer”, the total remains the same. 
1. Ali and Billy have money in the ratio of 5 : 4. After Ali gave Billy $20, they have an equal amount of money. How much money does Billy have in the end?
2. Amy, Ben and Cindy bought a present. Amy's share was 1/4 of Ben's and Cindy's share. Ben's share was 1/2 of Amy's and Cindy's share. Cindy's share was $17 more than that of Ben's. How much did the present cost?


 
## Constant Difference Concept
1. For questions relating to age, the age difference between 2 people will always remain the same.
1. The ages of Ali and Billy are in the ratio of 4 : 7. In 3 years’ time, their ages will be in the ratio of 3 : 5. How old is Billy now?

## Everything Changed Concept (Units and Parts)
1. This is a more challenging type of PSLE Math questions. 
2. Both sides of the ratio changed by different amounts. I recommend “Units and Parts” to solve this type of questions. 
3. The ratio of Ali’s money to Billy’s money was 2 : 1. After Ali saved another $60 and Billy spent $150, the ratio became 4 : 1. How much money did Ali have at first?


## Part-Whole Concept
1. Which you need to be clear on the relationship between the “part” and the “whole”. 
1. Kelly spent 1/3 of her money on 5 pens and 11 erasers. The cost of each pen is 3 times the cost of each eraser. She bought some more pens with 3/4 of her remaining money. How many pens did she buy altogether?

## Excess and shortage question
```
    Tom packed 5 balls into each bag and found that he had 8 balls left over.
If he packed 7 balls into each bag, he would need another 4 more balls.
    a) How many bags did he have?
    b) How many balls did he have altogether?
```

## Grouping Concept
1. This is another common concept which needs you to group items together, followed by finding the total number of groups. 
1. Mark bought an equal number of shorts and shirts for $100. A shirt cost $8 and each pair of shorts cost $12. How much did he spend on the shirts?

## Number x Value Concept
1. Under this concept, you multiply the number of units by the value of each unit to find the total value of 1 group. From here, you can find the total number of groups.
1. The ratio of the number of 50 cents coins to 1 dollar coin is 3 : 1. The total value of the coins is $12.50. How many coins are there in total?


## Guess and Check / Assumption Concept
1. Miss Lee bought some pencils for her class of 8 students. Each girl received 5 pencils and each boy received 2 pencils. She bought a total of 22 pencils.  How many boys were there in the class?

## Working Backwards Concept
1.  In this question, you are given the final value and you need to work backwards to find the starting value.
1. ```
    A bus left an interchange carrying some passengers with it.
    At the first stop, 1/4 of the people in it alighted and 5 people boarded it.
    At the 2nd stop, 1/2 of the people in it alighted and 20 people boarded the bus.
    When it left the 2nd stop, there were 60 passengers in it.
    How many passengers were there in the bus when it left the interchange?```

## Simultaneous Equations Concept
1. you need to form 2 equations to solve for 2 unknowns. 
1. Amy and Billy had a total of $400.  Amy spent 1/4 of her sum and Billy spent 2/5 of his. They then had a total of $255 left. How much did Amy spend?

## Double If Concept
1. It involves 2 “ifs” which represent 2 scenarios. 
1. ```
    A farmer has some chickens and ducks. If he sells 2 chickens and 3 ducks every day, there will be 50 chickens left when all the ducks have been sold. If he sells 3 chickens and 2 ducks every day, there will be 25 chickens left when all the ducks have been sold.

    a) how many ducks are there?

    b) how many chickens are there?
    ```

## Equal Stage
1. There can be equal stage at first or equal stage in the end. You can use the “Model Drawing” method to solve this question.
1. ```
    Helen and Ivan had the same number of coins. Helen had some 50-cent coins and 64 20-cent coins.
    Her coins had a total mass of 1.134 kg. Ivan had some 50-cent coins and 104 20-cent coins.
    a) Who had more money and how much more?
    b) Given that a 50-cent coin is 2.7 g heavier than a 20-cent coin, what is the mass of Ivan’s coins in kilograms?
    ```

## Interval
1. Questions involving intervals test your child on finding the number of gaps between the items.
1. Take note that the number of gaps is 1 less than the number of items.
1. ```
    Timothy participated in a marathon. There were drinking stations equally spaced along the route. Timothy took 48 min to run from the 1st drinking station to the 13th drinking station. Which drinking station would he reach after running for 120 min since the start of the marathon?
    ```

## Repeated Identity
1. Repeated Identity involves one of the items being repeated in the question. 
1. Your child needs to identify it and use the Ratio method and make it the same.
1. ```
    The number of adults to the number of children in a room is 5 : 6. There are twice as many boys as girls in the room. 

    If there are 10 more adults than boys, how many people are there inside the room?
    ```

## Replacement
1. It involves replacing one object with another object to solve the question. 
1. A school bus can either sit 24 adults or 36 children. If it already has 12 adults on the bus, how many more children can it sit?


## Samnple problems for excess and shortage
1. Memi has some balloons, if she packs 4 balloons in each bag, she will be short of 2 balloons, if she packs 6 balloons in each bac, she will be short of 28 balloons, how many bags does meimei has?
1. At first, chairs in a hall were arranged in rows of 6. 
    1. Then, 68 more chairs were brought in and all the chairs were rearranged into rows of 20. There were 12 fewer rows. How many rows of chairs were in the hall at first? 


## Tap rate problems
1. Tap A can fill a tank in 3 hours, while tap B can fill in 6 hours. In how much time will the tank be filled if both the taps are opened together?
1. When Taps A and B are turned on at the same time, they can fill up a container completely in 6 minutes. Tap A alone will take 10 minutes to fill up the container completely. How long will it take for Tap B alone to fill up the container completely?
