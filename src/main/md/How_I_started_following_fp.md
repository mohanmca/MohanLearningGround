***DON'T LAUGH for comparing me and Jonas Boner***

Those days I used to download google tech talk  and watch it using ipod, I remember watching following videos sometime in 2008, they changed my opinion about programming and started learning FP.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8frGknO8rIg - Faith, Evolution, and Programming Languages 

I also try to know the people who are masters in those subjects, I quickly ended up learning from "The Linq project" and understood that Java lags closure and understood all the debates around closure issues and proposal then. Linq kind of eye opening for me to realize that I shouldn't skip functional programming, during then I also used to watch Erik Meijer's videos and came to know what he is cooking in research lab using F#, It was RX.

By late 2008, I already subscribed to few Scala forum, and was trying to learn "Lift Web", and during then I assumed David Pollock as "Craig Mcclanahan" (Struts guy) of Scala world, there were few other guys were contributing to Lift. One of the guy was "Jonas Boner", and David used to modify and refactor Jonas's code.

Till today, You guys know where I am, whereas Jonas went-on built Akka and even became CTO of ~~Typesafe~~ Lightbend.

*Hence solving a bigger problem, and perseverance on the same project seems help to grow.*
