Here's a structured breakdown of the **AWS RDS Postmortem** thread using Markdown format:

---

## üß© Problem Summary

The user migrated a PostgreSQL database to AWS RDS, where an **unexpected auto-scaling event** degraded database performance, impacting multiple dependent services.

---

## üìä Key Facts

* **Date & Time**:

  * **Migration**: Sunday at 4:30 AM UTC
  * **Auto-scaling Trigger**: Sunday at 10:17 AM UTC
  * **Auto-scaling Completion**: 2:39 PM UTC

* **Initial Configuration**:

  * **RDS disk**: 200 GB
  * **Database size**: \~15 GB

* **Observed Behavior**:

  * RDS scaled disk to 999 GB despite only 15 GB being used
  * Performance degraded severely during scaling (e.g., `SELECT now()` took \~20s)
  * Services dependent on DB went down

* **AWS Support Response**:

  * Scaling to 999 GB is "not a problem"
  * Degraded performance during autoscaling is "expected behavior"
  * Database considered "online" as sessions were not dropped
  * Event duration could be ‚Äúminutes to several days‚Äù
  * Support would not assist with performance tuning or mitigation

---

## üîé Steps Taken to Investigate

1. **Support Contact**:

   * Initial support from AWS Business Plan was ineffective.
   * User reported canned responses with no action taken beyond basic communication.

2. **Community Input**:

   * **CloudWatch Metrics**:

     * Key clue discovered: sudden usage of the full 200 GB disk prior to autoscaling.
   * **Enhanced Monitoring**: Not enabled, but recommended for future events.
   * **Testing Context**:

     * Migration was thoroughly rehearsed in a Sandbox environment.
     * The only difference: smaller instance size in Sandbox (less CPU/RAM).

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:

   * Improper configuration of the `work_mem` parameter.
   * Some queries required large memory; lacking `work_mem` caused them to use **disk instead of memory**.
   * This disk usage led to rapid storage consumption, triggering autoscaling.
   * Autoscaling kicked in **before disk space alerts** did.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

* **Disk Usage Can Spike Due to Misconfiguration**:

  * Always validate memory settings (`work_mem`, etc.) when migrating workloads.

* **Disk Auto-Scaling Performance Impact**:

  * RDS disk scaling can degrade performance significantly.
  * Instance remains ‚Äúavailable‚Äù from AWS‚Äôs view even if practically unusable.

* **CloudWatch as a Critical Tool**:

  * CloudWatch metrics provided the critical clue to explain the space consumption.
  * Enhanced Monitoring may provide deeper insight into IOPS and disk behavior.

* **IOPS Limitations**:

  * RDS IOPS scales with disk size, but can still fall short compared to NVMe SSDs.
  * Background tasks (like disk mirroring) consume IOPS, exacerbating latency.

### Organizational Lessons

* **Support Plan Limitations**:

  * Business Support doesn't guarantee effective issue resolution.
  * AWS's ‚Äúshared responsibility‚Äù model often results in being "palmed off" unless higher-tier support (e.g., Enterprise On-Ramp) is used.

* **Escalation Options**:

  * Consider engaging a **TAM (Technical Account Manager)** if one is available.
  * Escalating through account managers may help in receiving more useful support.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

1. **Review and Configure Database Parameters Carefully**:
   * Especially `work_mem`, `maintenance_work_mem`, etc. for expected query loads.

2. **Monitor Disk Usage Proactively**:
   * Set tighter alerts in CloudWatch.
   * Monitor free space, temporary file creation, and log growth.

3. **Enable Enhanced Monitoring**:
   * Gain deeper visibility into the instance-level metrics.

4. **Right-Size Your RDS Configuration**:
   * If your DB is only 15 GB, a 200 GB disk may not be necessary.
   * Overprovisioning can introduce IOPS and cost inefficiencies.

5. **Consider Alternatives**:
   * Aurora may offer better scaling options‚Äîbut comes with its own tradeoffs.
   * For high control and transparency: explore self-managed PostgreSQL or distributed systems like CockroachDB, Cassandra, or YugabyteDB.

6. **Evaluate Support Plans**:
   * For production-critical systems, consider whether Business support suffices.
   * Upgrade if faster incident response and hands-on help are important.

Here is a structured markdown summary extracting the troubleshooting steps, approach, and key facts from the linked Hacker News discussion regarding AWS RDS/Postgres performance and migration:

## Summary: "Why Postgres RDS didn't work for us" (Hacker News Discussion)

### Troubleshooting Approach Extracted from the Thread

1. **Identify Performance Bottlenecks**
    - Users compared on-premise vs. RDS, noting that traditional metrics may not reveal causes of query hangs[1].
    - High I/O needs and latency were recurring themes; instance type (EBS, provisioned IOPS) had direct impact.

2. **Test Different Storage Architectures**
    - Some tried block devices with maximum IOPS and large volumes on EBS, emphasizing tuning for performance[1].
    - Others observed significantly lower latency and higher performance with local NVMe SSDs compared to EBS[1].

3. **Assess Instance Size and IOPS**
    - Discussion highlighted the importance of matching RDS instance size and provisioned IOPS to workload needs[1].
    - Noted that guaranteed EBS bandwidth only begins at specific instance sizes (e.g., db.r6g.4xlarge and above)[1].

4. **Evaluate Cost-effectiveness**
    - Multiple contributors directly compared costs between RDS, on-premise servers, and alternate hosting (e.g., colocation, VPS), often finding cloud to be substantially more expensive for comparable hardware and performance[1].

5. **Attempt Database Architecture Alternatives**
    - Investigated alternatives like Aurora (not backed by EBS), ClickHouse, DuckDB, Citus, and TimescaleDB for specific workloads (e.g., analytics, time series)[1].
    - Some organizations found success switching entirely or partially to more optimized database systems after encountering RDS/EBS limitations.

6. **Examine Network and Client Setup**
    - Real-world troubleshooting included examining end-to-end system architecture‚Äîfinding, for example, Wi-Fi connections adding substantial latency beyond the database layer itself[1].

7. **Leverage AWS Features and Newer Options**
    - Mention of AWS I/O Optimized features and RDS Optimized Reads, suggesting review of new AWS offerings for performance improvement[1].

8. **Infrastructure Ownership and Responsibility**
    - Teams weighed the trade-off between cloud's managed services (lifecycle, backup, scaling) and the cost, control, and predictability of running dedicated hardware and managing their own operations[1].

### Key Troubleshooting Steps (as Markdown List)

1. Measure database CPU, memory, and IOPS under real workloads.
2. Compare EBS vs. local NVMe SSD latency and throughput.
3. Upgrade RDS instance type or enable provisioned IOPS.
4. Calculate and benchmark performance vs. cost both in cloud and on-premise.
5. Profile query latency and assess effects of storage backend (EBS vs. Aurora vs. self-hosted).
6. Investigate client network path for additional latency sources.
7. Explore switching to more suitable database technologies (e.g., ClickHouse, DuckDB).
8. Keep abreast of new AWS features optimizing for I/O.
9. Test backup, restore, scaling features and contrast with in-house capabilities.
10. Consult AWS account teams and documentation for deep architectural review.

### Generalized Lessons Learned (Extracted from Multiple Comments)

- Storage choice (EBS vs. SSD) is often the biggest cloud DB performance variable; relational databases are sensitive to write latency[1].
- Cloud DB cost can vastly exceed dedicated hardware for the same workload, even when accounting for operational overhead[1].
- Self-hosting or using dedicated hardware can slash costs but transfers maintenance risk and responsibility to your team[1].
- AWS's managed features save operational toil but are never as cheap as direct hardware ownership[1].
- Cloud features and instance types/limits change rapidly‚Äîalways re-evaluate for significant workloads.

Here is a structured markdown summary extracting the troubleshooting steps, approach, and key facts from the Hacker News discussion at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37290417, focusing on user feedback regarding AWS RDS Multi-AZ version upgrades and related operational issues.

## Summary: AWS RDS Multi-AZ Version Upgrade Experience (Hacker News 37290417)

### Troubleshooting Approach and Facts

1. **Clarifying Expected Behavior**
   - Users experienced unexpected downtime during engine version upgrades in RDS instances configured with Multi-AZ.

2. **Understanding Upgrade Mechanism**
   - AWS Support clarified that for Multi-AZ instances, both primary and secondary DBs undergo engine upgrades simultaneously, causing both to be unavailable at the same time.
   - Failover cannot occur during an engine version upgrade because changes must be synchronized across all nodes before becoming active.

3. **Review and Configuration Options**
   - Users can opt out of automatic minor version upgrades to prevent surprise outages, but then must manage upgrades manually.
   - Multi-AZ primarily assists with failure scenarios like instance, AZ outages, OS patching, or manual failover‚Äî*not* for reducing downtime on engine upgrades.

4. **Downtime Scenarios Identified by AWS**
    - Multi-AZ failover protects from the following:
        - Availability Zone outages
        - Primary DB instance failure
        - Server type change on DB instance
        - OS patching events
        - Manual failover via admin action

5. **Consulting Documentation and Support**
   - AWS Support recommends reviewing official documentation for further details about opt-out procedures and Multi-AZ failover mechanics.

### Troubleshooting Steps (as Markdown List)

1. Observe and log the nature and timing of database downtime during scheduled upgrades.
2. Contact AWS Support to clarify whether the observed downtime is expected in your configuration.
3. Review RDS configuration:
    - Check Multi-AZ settings.
    - Confirm whether automatic minor version upgrades are enabled.
4. If minimal downtime is required, opt out of automatic upgrades and schedule/manage them manually.
5. Familiarize yourself with AWS documentation for Multi-AZ behaviors during different maintenance activities.
6. Evaluate whether Multi-AZ deployment meets your high-availability needs given upgrade behavior.
7. Share downtime scenarios with your team to set accurate expectations for production changes.
8. Rate or provide feedback to AWS Support for their help and update your runbooks with new findings.

### General Lessons Learned

- Multi-AZ deployments in RDS *do not* guarantee zero downtime for engine version upgrades; both the primary and standby are unavailable simultaneously during such events.
- Opting out of automatic minor upgrades places upgrade scheduling and risk squarely on the user.
- Multi-AZ is most effective for unplanned outages, not for all types of planned maintenance.
- Always review and understand the documented behavior of managed services before relying on them for specific availability guarantees.
