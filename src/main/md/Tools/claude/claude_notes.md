## Effective usage of claude
1. Use plan mode before aking claude to do actual coding/change
2. Ask Claude to explain
    1. Please explain the functionality and code you just built out in detail. Walk me through we\hat you changed and how it works. Act like youâ€™re a senior engineer teaching me code
4. Ask feedback about how to use it effectively
5. Try not to loose the claude context
6.
