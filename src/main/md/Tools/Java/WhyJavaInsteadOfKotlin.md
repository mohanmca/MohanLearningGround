## Why should we stay with Java?

1. To develop in Kotlin well, you should also know Java. So now you really need to know two languages.
2. What is the principle of Kotlin?
   1. Better than Java? Is that even a programming paradigm?
3. 99% of the people writing Kotlin are using IntelliJ. Kotlin is built to sell IntelliJ.
4. One can program in a functional style like Scala. One can program in an OO style like Java. Without constraint every developer would write code in their own way?
   1. Why no Go-lang? It gives constraint?
5. Kotlin is to Java as CoffeeScript is to JavaScript.
   1. CoffeeScript died, but JS adopted most of its feature in 2015
6. Java and Kotlin will gradually diverge, particularly as Java gains features which are similar to Kotlin features but implements them slightly differently. 
   1. Third party library APIs will start use the new constructs and you'll be stuck with two slightly different ways of doing something very similar in your codebase.
7. It's that we have millions of lines of java code across hundreds of projects that will not be ported. 
   1. Having to context switch in between maintaining projects is another stone on top of tech-debt mountain.
   2. IDE's would be smarter to convert older java to later than java to Kotlin
8. Optional vs Nullable - Different way of coding, Java optional is functional
9. Kotlin will be an evolutionary dead end as Java catches up on features.
