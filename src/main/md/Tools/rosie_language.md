# Rosie Pattern Language replaces regex (RPL)

* What is problem with regex, how it fits with big-data?
* What is the role of rosie?
* Use cases of rosie

* Regex
  * regular grammar and doesn't support all recursive grammar
  * These expressions can be difficult to write, and are notoriously difficult to read and maintain.
  * Not modular, Can't compose and Not debuggable
  * Not suitable for bigdata
  * Not possessive - would backtrack and consider different match (would cause performance delay)
  * PCRE regtex functions can match much more than regular languages (Perl Compatible REgex)
  
* Grok
  * Grok is apparently the plugin most depended upon for extracting information from log records,
  * Grok has a library of named regex patterns
  * Grok has proven to be flower than Rosie by a factor of around 4
  * Grok patterns are not as expressive as RPL, but more powerful than regex

* RPL
  * Based on PEG, could express recursive structures (like XML and JSON) that regular expressions cannot. 
  * PEG can run in linear time in the size of the input data, making them a good choice for processing big data.
  * Supports contex-free grammar
  * Like programming language
  * RPL := Comments + Modules + Identifiers + Whitespace + Quoted Literals + Unit Tests + Macros
  * Standard Patterns in the standard library

* RPL
  * is greedy - * would try to match as long as match possible (opposite is lazy as few as possible)
  * i possesive - possessive if the matching engine will not backtrack to consider a different match
  
  
# RPL VS REGEX
* In regex or match would use | (pipe)
* In RPL or match would use / (slash)
