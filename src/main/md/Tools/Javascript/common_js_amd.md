# CommonJS
* Initial goal was to create standard server side library for Javascript 
* If standard library is required, there should be modular way to package and load them, so CommonJS also covers module portion of it
* It also specified list of libraries (packages) like binary, encodings, io, fs, sockets, event-queue, worker and console along with modules


# RequireJS
* Despite CommonJs solved modular issue, it assumed everything is on server, synchronous loading, hence didn't work for browser
* AMD specification tried to solve it, and requirejs is common implementation being used
