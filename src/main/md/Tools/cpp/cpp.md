## What is hello world program in CPP?

```c++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main(void) {
  cout << "It's working\n" << endl;
}
```

## Coverting C++ into a program
1. g++ -S main.cpp -o main.s (Produces human readable assembly code)
2. g++ -c main.cpp -o main.o (Produces object file)
3. g++ main.cpp -o main (Produces executable using compiles, assembles and links)
   4. Linking the library is done by the linker, which is called by the compiler.
   5. During linking the linker will resolve the symbols in the object files and libraries.
6. g++ --std=c++11 main.cpp -o main (Use C++11 standard)

## Data types
1. 3E8 == 300,000,000 = 3 x 10^8
2. Plancks constant - 6.62607E-34
3. Divide by zero might cause - compilation error, runtime error or some message at runtime.
   4. Division by 0 invokes undefined behaviour
4. Operators of larger (higher) priority perform their operations before the operators with lower priority.
5. Binding, C++ mostly left binding. 

## What is simplest C++ program that processes command line String

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    std::vector<std::string> arguments;

    for (int i = 0; i < argc; ++i) {
        arguments.push_back(argv[i]);
    }

    for (const std::string& arg : arguments) {
        std::cout << arg << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Tidbits about C++

1. in C++, all strings are considered as arrays
2. Char is just subset of number, that would be treated as alphabets. ASCII mapping.
3. In ASCII, --- space is 32, A = 65, A+___ (space) = a, 97
4. \0 = nul char, represent no-character
5. '\47' = Octal chracter, 39 decimal == '\'', '\x27'
6. you can mix and match int with char and perform arithmatic operation
7.   'a' - ' ', a - 32, 'A' + 32, 'A' + ' '
8. 'uint64_t' {aka 'long unsigned int'}

## Stream has two responsible
1. Converting any types into human readable
2. Transfer them to output device
3. You can use *manipulator* along with stream to transform values
4. hex is one manipulator, changes the output streams properties called *basefield*
5. hex, dec, oct are the other manipulators
6. Manipulators
7. endl is a manipulator

## Manipulator Examples
```C++
int main() {
    int byte = 255;
    cout << hex << byte << endl;
    cout << byte << endl << dec << byte<<endl;
}
```

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    float PI = 3.14;
    int num = 100;
    cout << "Entering a new line." << endl;
    cout << setw(10) << "Output" << endl;
    cout << setprecision(10) << PI << endl;
    cout << setbase(16) << num << endl; //sets base to 16
}
```

* The sign << is called the insertion operator.
* The sign >> is called the extraction operator.
* cout keyword is used to print.
* cin keyword is used to take input at run time.


## Find SQRT of a float

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main(void) {
        float value, squareroot;

        cout << "Give me a number and I will find its square root:" << endl;
        cin >> value;
        
	        squareroot = sqrtf(value);
	        cout << "You have given: " << value << endl;
	        cout << "The square root is: " << squareroot << endl;
        
        return 0;
}
```

## datatype modifers to reduce memory or increase width of the number
1. modifiers such as long/short/unsigned would either decrease the memory usage of primitivie-data-type such as int, or increase to suit larger number
2. long int == long, short int = short, unsigned int = unsigned
3. char == [-128 to 127], unsigned char == 0 255
4. long can be declared in 3 days
	5. literal value goes beyond the acceptable range of type int; 98l or 987L (suffix L)
 6. short modifer never works with float, but `long float` would work, 'long float == double'
 7. double can store larger number and with better accuracy
 8. float would store 8 digits after decimal point for accuracy, double would store 15-17 accuracy
 9. numerical anomaly - is unavoidable

## boolean
1. bool developer_is_hubgry =  true
2. boolean is like int, but it uses only 8-bit (1 - byte)
3. zero == false, non-zero == true

## empty for-loop
1. when data missing, c++ assumes 1 is there, hence below is infinite;
```c++
for( ; ; ) {
  /* the body goes here */ 
}
```

## Logical opertion on it
```
C++ also uses - two's complement numbers
i: 00000000000000000000000000001111
j: 00000000000000000000000000010110
int log = i && j;
log:00000000000000000000000000000001
int bit = i & j;
bit:00000000000000000000000000000110
```

## Unsigned CPP (double the range)
```
unsigned int myUnsignedVariable = 0;
myUnsignedVariable--;  // Decrementing from 0
It will wrap around, and the result will be the maximum value representable by an unsigned int. For a 32-bit unsigned int, the maximum value is 4294967295.
```

## Switch case
1. Missing break is big mistake
2. Value after the case must not be an expression containing variables or any other entities whose values aren't known at compilation time;
```
switch(i) {
    case 1: cout << "Only one?" << endl; break;
    case 2: cout << "I want more" << endl; break;
    case 3: 
    case 4: cout << "OK and work for 3 Or 4" << endl; break;
    default: cout << "Don't care"  << endl;
}
```

## What is CRTP?

```cpp
template<class Z> class Y {};
class X : public Y<X> {};
```

## What is shared smart pointer and how to create?
```
In this example, std::make_shared<MyClass>(10) creates a new instance of MyClass with 10 as the argument to its constructor, 
and returns a std::shared_ptr that owns the newly created object. 
The std::shared_ptr will automatically delete the object when there are no more std::shared_ptr objects pointing to it.
```
```cpp
#include <memory>

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(int val) : value(val) {}
    int value;
};

int main() {
    std::shared_ptr<MyClass> ptr = std::make_shared<MyClass>(10);
    return 0;
}
```

## Many more
1. int vector[5] = {0,1,2,3,4}; //array with initializaion
2. If you provide fewer values than the size of an array, like this, nothing bad will happen.
  3. he compiler determines that those elements you didnâ€˜t specify any value to should be set to 0.
  4. int vector[5] = {0,1,2};
  5. int vector[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}; //this is legal
  6. int chessboard[8][8];
4. fill first 100 slots with -1 for an array - ```std::fill_n(array, 100, -1);```
