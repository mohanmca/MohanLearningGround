Given the full context of our discussion—including your high-volume PostgreSQL `COPY` workload, insert performance degradation over time, and analysis of wait events (like `IO:DataFileRead` and `WALWrite`)—you'll benefit from a **well-rounded set of documents and blogs** that go beyond just FSM. These resources cover key PostgreSQL internals and performance topics that **directly affect bulk data ingestion** performance.

## 🧠 Key Concepts to Understand (Beyond FSM)

| Area                            | Why It Matters                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WAL behavior and tuning**     | `COPY` is WAL-heavy unless optimized with `UNLOGGED` or `FREEZE`  |
| **Index maintenance and bloat** | Indexes slow inserts and grow over time, increasing I/O           |
| **Autovacuum internals**        | Needed for freezing, dead tuple cleanup, and FSM updates          |
| **Table & index bloat**         | Affects heap/index page size, FSM accuracy, and insertion latency |
| **Storage layout & fillfactor** | Impacts page splits and I/O efficiency during inserts             |
| **Partitioning**                | Can reduce insert overhead and improve index locality             |

### 1. **“Understanding PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)”**

Covers what WAL is, how it behaves under heavy insert/COPY load, how to tune it (e.g., `synchronous_commit`, `wal_buffers`, `wal_writer_delay`), and when it becomes a bottleneck.

### 3. **“Avoiding PostgreSQL Index Bloat”** – CYBERTEC

Discusses how continuous inserts can lead to bloated indexes, how to measure it, and how to clean it up. Includes guidance on index fillfactor, reindexing, and `pgstattuple` usage.
