## Sample communications
* Try to communicate within 30-40 words.
  * Difficult but should learn
* Preparation for 30–40 words may sound like a lot of work. It is a lot of work.
* To a co-founder: ‘When you said, “I’m not happy with your work,” to me in front of the team, I felt embarrassed because it didn’t meet my need for trust and recognition. Please, could we set up a weekly one-on-one session to share feedback in private?’
* To an investor: ‘I haven’t received any responses from the last three monthly updates. I’m feeling concerned because I need input. Please, would you mind getting back to me with responses to my questions in the last update?’
* To a teammate: ‘You arrived 10 minutes late to the last three team meetings. I am frustrated because, as a team, we have a need for efficiency. Please, could you help me understand what’s happening?’ 
----
## Despite all effort, when there is 'No', how to react?
* Delivering 'NO' was difficult to other person
* Show empathy - Empathy is the gift of hearing someone without taking it personally
* When you have to say ‘no’
  * State the underlying need that stops you from saying ‘yes’.
## Effective communication consequences
* Purpose is to protect our needs, not to punish the other person.
*
