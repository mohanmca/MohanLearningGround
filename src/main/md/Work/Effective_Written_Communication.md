### Tools for listener to be effective

* As the listener, before responding, it's a good habit to say "This is what I understand about your proposal" and proceed to summarize and give the original speaker an opportunity to correct you.
* Listener should be able to reflect communicator world view back to the communicator as if listener would be advocating for it (even if listener completely disagree).
* Send minutes right after the meeting (immediately), and ask other participants to correct it
