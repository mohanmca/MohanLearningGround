# [How to speak by Patrick Winston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&t=28s)

* Succcess in life is determined by (order)
  * Ability to speak -1
  * Ability to write -2
  * Quality of your ideas -3
* Ability to speak is highest order
  *  Ability-to-Speak = f(K,P,t)
    * Knowledge, Practice and in-herent talent
    * Knowledge would be important than in-herent talent


## Armamentarium of presentation

* Starting with a joke is not recommended
* Start with empowerment promise
  * Reason for being here
  * How that 60 minutes would help them
  * Example: In next 60 minutes, you will know about speaking, that you don't know now. And something among things you know will make a difference in your life.
  * How cool this topic is going to be? What problem this talk is going to address
* Need to repeat the topic
  * We might need to repeat 3 times, as not everyone might not paid attention at the same time
* Build a fence around your idea.
  * What my version of this subject would be
  * What an Arch is? What an Arch is not?
  * This seems like similar to Jone's algorithm, but this is linear and his is exponential
* Verbal punctuation
* Ask a question
  * How long to wait for answer. 7 seconds seems to be neutral.


## How speed people can follow?

* They can follow the speed of black-board writing
* They can't follow at the speed of slides

## How to keep hands

* Hands shouldn't be in pocket, and tied backwards like concealing weapons, not a good body langauge sign
* Should be open palm
* Few Presenter point at something that is not relevant, gesture of passion and not hiding anything like hands are in packet

## Effect of props, chalk (rather slides)

* Writing & doing while presenting, others feel the same (and conected), slides doesn't give that effect
* Neurons gets the effect as if others trying to do themselves when presenter doing something with prop
* There are always too many slides, too many words
* Slides are distraction to presentation
  * Learners can either read or listen - not both
  * Everyone has one processor
* Too much of lazer pointer and other pointers like stick would reduce human eye contact
* An hapax legomenon
  * Some complex slides can be used only once (and refered once)

## How to cover topic

* Cover general principles and topic that matters - 80%
* Cover few special cases
* Cover few situation cases
* Entire talk about too generic or too specific is useless

## People never get used to be ignored

* Ideas are like our children, anyone ignoring is big matters to them
* Learning how to present our ideas is very important, without that good ideas won't gain support. Rather ignored.
* How to present your ideas
  * Symbols associate with your ideas (visual perception is the best way to attract attention)
  * Slogan (describing your idea)
  * Surprise (common fallacy that is no longer true, for instance, just after you’ve told about it)
  * Salient Idea (not necessarily important but the one that sticks out)
  * Story (how you did it, how it works…)

## How to END

* Never thank at the end, It should be at the begining
* Never end talk with questions.
* Finish with a joke
  * They think entire talk was fun
* Never finish with Thankyou
  * Don't thank for staying politely
  * They are their for purpose, and you did your homework
* End with gesture like salute
* We can say, "It is great fun to present" or "It is great fun to be here"


* What is final slide
* What is final words


## Someone's else note from youtube (User name was ___GRIG ___)

Start
1. Do not start a talk with a joke.
2. Promise - Tell them what they gonna learn at the end of your talk.
3. Cycle – make your idea repeated many times in order to be completely clear for everyone.
4. Make a “Fence” around your idea so that it can be distinguished from someone else’s idea.
5. Verbal punctuation – sum up information within your talk some times to make listeners get back on.
6.  Ask a question - intriguing one

Place and Time

7. Best time for having a lecture is 11 am.
 (not too early and not after lunch)
8. The place should be well lit.
9. The place should be seen and checked before the lecture.
10. The place should not be full less than a half, it must be chosen according to the amount of listeners.

Tools
For teaching.
1. Board – it’s got graphics, speed, target. Watch your hands! Don’t hold them behind your back, it’s better to keep them straight and use for pointing at the board.
2. Props – use them in order to make your ideas visual.
Visual perception is the most effective way to interact with listeners.

For Job Talk. Exposing, Slides
3. Don’t put too many words on a slide. Slides should just reflect what you’re saying, not the other way around. Pictures attracts attention and people start to wait for your explanation – use that tip.
4. Make slide as easy as you can – no title, no distracting pictures, frames, points and so on.
5. Do not use laser pointer – due to that you lose eye contact with the audience. Instead you can make the arrows just upon a slide. 

Informing
 
Show to your listeners your stuff is cool and interesting.
You have to be able to:
-show your vision of that problem
-show that you’ve done particular things (by steps)
All of that should be done real quick in no more than 5 min.
Persuade your listeners you’re not a rookie (Prof. Winston contrived to do that from the very first seconds of his talk)

Getting Famous
If you want to your ideas be remembered you’ve got to have
 "5 S"


- Symbols associate with your ideas (visual perception is the best way to attract attention)
- Slogan (describing your idea)
- Surprise (common fallacy that is no longer true, for instance, just after you’ve told about it)
- Salient Idea (not necessarily important but the one that sticks out)
- Story (how you did it, how it works…)

How to End

- Don’t put collaborators at the end, do that at the beginning.
- Question’s the worst way to end a talk.
- It’s good to end with a Contribution slide – to sum up everything you’ve told with your OWN decision.
- At the very end you could tell a joke since people then will leave the event feeling fun and thus keep a good memory of your talk.
- "Thank you (for listening)" isn’t good ending, it’s trite at least. You can end with a quote of a prominent person (my own knowledge), with a salute to people (how much you valued the time being here, the people over here..., “I’d like to get back, it was fun!”

That part actually I find the hardest one, since saying “Thanks” is a kind of a habit and it’s really difficult to make people clap if your talk wasn’t fascinating, so you’d better do this great and you won’t have to worry about how to end!
