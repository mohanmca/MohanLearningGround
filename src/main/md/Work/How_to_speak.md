# [How to speak by Patrick Winston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&t=28s)

* Succcess in life is determined by (order)
  * Ability to speak -1
  * Ability to write -2
  * Quality of your ideas -3
* Ability to speak is highest order
  *  Ability-to-Speak = f(K,P,t)
    * Knowledge, Practice and in-herent talent
    * Knowledge would be important than in-herent talent


## Armamentarium of presentation

* Starting with a joke is not recommended
* Start with empowerment promise
  * Reason for being here
  * How that 60 minutes would help them
  * Example: In next 60 minutes, you will know about speaking, that you don't know now. And something among things you know will make a difference in your life.
  * How cool this topic is going to be? What problem this talk is going to address
* Need to repeat the topic
  * We might need to repeat 3 times, as not everyone might not paid attention at the same time
* Build a fence around your idea.
  * What my version of this subject would be
  * What an Arch is? What an Arch is not?
  * This seems like similar to Jone's algorithm, but this is linear and his is exponential
* Verbal punctuation
* Ask a question
  * How long to wait for answer. 7 seconds seems to be neutral.


## How speed people can follow?

* They can follow the speed of black-board writing
* They can't follow at the speed of slides

## How to keep hands

* Hands shouldn't be in pocket, and tied backwards like concealing weapons, not a good body langauge sign
* Should be open palm
* Few Presenter point at something that is not relevant, gesture of passion and not hiding anything like hands are in packet

## Effect of props, chalk (rather slides)

* Writing & doing while presenting, others feel the same (and conected), slides doesn't give that effect
* Neurons gets the effect as if others trying to do themselves when presenter doing something with prop
* There are always too many slides, too many words
* Slides are distraction to presentation
  * Learners can either read or listen - not both
  * Everyone has one processor
* Too much of lazer pointer and other pointers like stick would reduce human eye contact
* An hapax legomenon
  * Some complex slides can be used only once (and refered once)

## How to cover topic

* Cover general principles and topic that matters - 80%
* Cover few special cases
* Cover few situation cases
* Entire talk about too generic or too specific is useless

## People never get used to be ignored

* Ideas are like our children, anyone ignoring is big matters to them
* Learning how to present our ideas is very important, without that good ideas won't gain support. Rather ignored.
* How to present your ideas
  * Symbol (for idea)
  * Slogan
  * Surprise (some surprise with an example)
  * Salient Idea (not important, but something to stick in the presentation)
  * Story

## How to stop

* Never thank at the end, It should be at the begining
* Never end talk with questions?
* Finish with a joke
  * They think entire talk was fun
* Never finish with Thankyou
  * Don't thank for staying politely
  * They are their for purpose, and you did your homework
* End with gesture like salute
* We can say, "It is great fun to present" or "It is great fun to be here"


* What is final slide
* What is final words
