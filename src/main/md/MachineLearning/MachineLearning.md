## Getting Started with Machine Learning in Python - Rudy Lai

## Topics
* Environment to create ML models
* Prepare your datasets for ML with data cleaning
* Putting data into the right categories (classification - Not continious)
* Regression is opposite of classification (Predication - Continious)
* UnSupervised Learning: Segmenting Groups and Detecting Outliers
* Modelling complex relationships with Nonlinear models
  
## Rule based vs ML
* Rule based functions are table driven, developed by developer
* ML functions are complex, they are not defined by developer
* Machine derives function itself based on model and data
* How helicopter should fly can't be defined in single function
* ML = data + model + feedback_loop
* ML models are simplification are real-life
* feedback_loop is feeding the error back to system as a feedback
* Without data, there is no ML

## Tasks
* ML is all about predicting things
* Regression is the task of predicting numbers
* Classification is the task of predicting labels

## Why python
* Lots of modules related to data
* Interpretted - Feedback loop is faster in python due to REPL
* Large amount of ML modules are available
  * Pandas - Ability to manage tabular data
  * Scikit-Learn
  * Jupyter Notebook - Combine normal document with Python code
