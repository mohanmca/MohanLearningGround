## Guidelines
* Be patient and listen, listen and listen without any judgement. There is no better friend than active listening. 
* No one likes a know-it-all - Be honest, confident and humble
* You will still do something embarrassing. And you will survive. You can't improve if you are worried about your mistakes. Don't worry about it!
* Observe what everyone is doing. Ask questions.
* Be comfortable asking others for help or referencing documentation, Try not-to-figure-out-yourself unless that is expected
* Follow Before You Lead, 
  * Be tolerant of practices that are foreign to your established approach.
  * Mastering established team practices and rituals builds trust.
* Automating an existing process is likely to be better received than making an independent decision to replace an existing tool.
* Spend some of your personal time mastering and enhancing tools the team uses.
* Ensure your output is reviewed by existing employee before it is rolled out.

## Don't
* Don’t try to join in on every conversation. Don’t ask people to clarify every inside joke.
* Don’t say something controversial if no one was asking for your opinion.
* Pointing out that the way you did something at your old job was better than the way your new employer does it. Don't do it!
* Giving your new co-workers unsolicited advice on 'best practices' in their areas of expertise.
* Walking in and immediately announcing the changes ("improvements") you plan to make -- before asking anybody why they do things the way they do.
* Expressing your shock or disappointment at the way your new company does things
* Telling everybody who will listen about your fabulous credentials.
* Bossing your co-workers around (when you're not the boss -- or even if you are!).
* Making a remark -- even a joke -- that suggests your new company should be grateful you showed up to save them from their unsophisticated ways.
* Approaching your new assignment with the cookie-cutter mindset "This company is no different from the other companies I've worked for." (That's not true!)
* Joking along the lines "If I'd known in advance that your company was stuck in the Dark Ages, I would never have taken the job!"
* Expressing frustration with your co-workers for their failure to meet your high standards for anything -- punctuality, subject-matter expertise or professionalism, for instance.
