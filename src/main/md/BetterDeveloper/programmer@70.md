**Programming is not what I do, but who I am.**

# Bias against old programmers
* The major problem for older programmers is that people believe that the ability to learn decreases with age
* Older programmers have higher salary requirements. My company interviewed (and eventually hired) a 60-year-old iOS developer, and he asked us for double what the developers in their 30s were asking for.

# Fundamental skills
* What good developers requires are trust and good communication. 
* Trust to know that you will get there.
* Communication to see how things work (from both sides) and be able to match up skills with trends.

# Good
* Working many years in same company, but differnt kinds of projects and acquiring differnt skills
* In software - It's highly desirable for an engineer to be adaptable - Changing companies is a good way to expose yourself to different environments/perspectives (and therefore become adaptable). It's hard to get the same range of experiences from a single company.
* Stay relatively current but continually grow your knowledge depth.
* You need to be visible, to be found, to be reckoned good, and to develop some kind of reputation. 
* There are programmers who are nearing 70s and still fits finein startup crowd. Some of them are most  liked in the company and they also do lot of extracurricular activities.

# Advantages
* The latest tech is often nothing new, and is instead just a repackaging of prior concepts. Leverage that advantage.
* If you combine solid programming with deep subject domain experience, you offer something that is quite rare.
* Should have something special to offer.


# To avoid
* Some of the older engineers that ended up staying with a single employer for the longest (say 10+ years in one job) generally have the most difficulty finding new work when the time comes.
* "Ten years of experience or one year ten times".
* You got more than 25 years of experience, but not very specialized! you will not get a job anymore.
* Don't work for the man, especially when the man is just a boy.
