**Programming is not what I do, but who I am.**

# Bias against old programmers
* The major problem for older programmers is that people believe that the ability to learn decreases with age
* Older programmers have higher salary requirements. My company interviewed (and eventually hired) a 60-year-old iOS developer, and he asked us for double what the developers in their 30s were asking for.
* Startups require developers to pick up technologies you're not comfortable with, and expect to put 60+ hours, whereas older ones may need to spend evenings with their family.
* Think slowly, and doen't have the ability to push stuff out the door quickly
* Some of the old people are with very strong opinions and aren't pragmatists.
* If they started their family in 50s,  Having a toddlers or young kids at that age will make even more complicated
* age != experience != skill

# Fundamental skills
* What good developers requires are trust and good communication. 
* Trust to know that you will get there.
* Communication to see how things work (from both sides) and be able to match up skills with trends.

# Good
* Working many years in same company, but differnt kinds of projects and acquiring differnt skills
* In software - It's highly desirable for an engineer to be adaptable - Changing companies is a good way to expose yourself to different environments/perspectives (and therefore become adaptable). It's hard to get the same range of experiences from a single company.
* Stay relatively current but continually grow your knowledge depth.
* You need to be visible, to be found, to be reckoned good, and to develop some kind of reputation. 
* There are programmers who are nearing 70s and still fits fine in startup crowd. Some of them are most  liked in the company and they also do lot of extracurricular activities.
* An old patient is better than a new doctor

# Advantages
* The latest tech is often nothing new, and is instead just a repackaging of prior concepts. Leverage that advantage.
* If you combine solid programming with deep subject domain experience, you offer something that is quite rare.
* Should have something special to offer.
* If programming is your passion, it might show one-way or other, you may not need to worry that much. Programming is not what I do, but who I am.

# To avoid
* Some of the older engineers that ended up staying with a single employer for the longest (say 10+ years in one job) generally have the most difficulty finding new work when the time comes.
* "Ten years of experience or one year ten times".
* You got more than 25 years of experience, but not very specialized! you will not get a job anymore.
* Don't work for the man, especially when the man is just a boy.
