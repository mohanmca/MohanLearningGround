## Guidelines
* Be patient and listen, listen and listen without any judgement. There is no better friend than active listening. 
* No one likes a know-it-all - Be honest, confident and humble
* You will still do something embarrassing. And you will survive. You can't improve if you are worried about your mistakes. Don't worry about it!
* Observe what everyone is doing. Ask questions.
* Be comfortable asking others for help or referencing documentation, Try not-to-figure-out-yourself unless that is expected
* Follow Before You Lead, 
  * Be tolerant of practices that are foreign to your established approach.
  * Mastering established team practices and rituals builds trust.
* Automating an existing process is likely to be better received than making an independent decision to replace an existing tool.
* Spend some of your personal time mastering and enhancing tools the team uses.
* Ensure your output is reviewed by existing employee before it is rolled out.

## Don't
* Don’t try to join in on every conversation. Don’t ask people to clarify every inside joke.
* Don’t say something controversial if no one was asking for your opinion.
* Pointing out that the way you did something at your old job was better than the way your new employer does it. Don't do it!
* Giving your new co-workers unsolicited advice on 'best practices' in their areas of expertise.
* Walking in and immediately announcing the changes ("improvements") you plan to make -- before asking anybody why they do things the way they do.
* Expressing your shock or disappointment at the way your new company does things
* Telling everybody who will listen about your fabulous credentials.
* Bossing your co-workers around (when you're not the boss -- or even if you are!).
* Making a remark -- even a joke -- that suggests your new company should be grateful you showed up to save them from their unsophisticated ways.
* Approaching your new assignment with the cookie-cutter mindset "This company is no different from the other companies I've worked for." (That's not true!)
* Joking along the lines "If I'd known in advance that your company was stuck in the Dark Ages, I would never have taken the job!"
* Expressing frustration with your co-workers for their failure to meet your high standards for anything -- punctuality, subject-matter expertise or professionalism, for instance.

## Three rules from Group (Overall good)
* Let your manager know that you are aggressive and would like to take up more work. Or own something. This always worked for me and gave me an opportunity to work with interesting stuff.
* Let your colleagues and your manager know the truth about how much you "don't" know about the tools and tech they use. (if you know everything already, you should find a new job). Tell them that you have "some" exposure in the things that you know. Be kind and humble but work real hard. I usually aim for twice as hard most days (in terms of hours). But DON'T COMPETE. Contribute to their work. Shadow them. Give them credit publicly, privately and to your bosses. You'll see that your favour is returned very soon. 
* Don't let your insecurities drive you. Remember, you needn't prove anything. You've been recognized as someone who can add value to the organization. That's the reason you have the offer letter.
* Smile a lot 

### Five cautious group from Group (Think about it, first two make sense, others are debatable)
* The most important rule is to understand your own goal at the organization and then plan a path. Whatever you do should be aligned to that goal. Its not an army where everyone has the same goal. Try to be practical.
* Help as many people as you can. Have people on your side. Share as much knowledge as you can but dont brag. Dont make people treat you special.
* Too honest will get you screwed up so fast. Learn to know the audience and say only what matters. Realize that everyone has a different agenda and what you say will be used against you at some point. Tread carefully.
* Be a roman when you are in Rome. Dont be an outlier. Management hates outliers.
* Dont challenge your boss even in private. Remember your boss will remain as a boss forever. Its rare that someone overtakes the boss. He grows you grow. Help your boss grow or atleast act as if you care.
