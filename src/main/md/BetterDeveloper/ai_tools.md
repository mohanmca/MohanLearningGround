## What is hard for AI?
1. Hiring
2. Testing
3. Understanding end-2-end
4. Able to read code quickly with human eyes
5. Human thinking
6. They are weak at judgment, taste, long-term thinking, and adversarial reasoning.
7. Designing something that will survive 5–20 years


## Evaluation Is Harder Than Generation
9. Choosing the right pattern under tradeoffs
10. Rejecting patterns entirely
11. Inventing constraints-aware architectures
12. Designing something that will survive 5–20 years

## Humans  with scar 
1. Ask “what if this is malformed?”
1. Think about race conditions.
1. Think about partial failures.
1. Think about malicious actors.

## System-Level Thinking (Beyond Files)
0. LLM good at thinking file-levels
1. Maintaining system-wide invariants.
2. Enforcing conceptual integrity.
3. Ensuring consistent abstraction boundaries.

## Knowing When Not to Reinvent the Wheel
1. Understand social proof.
2. Understand long-term ecosystem stability.
3. Value mature libraries.
4. Understand liability.

## Human vs AI

| Area             | AI Weakness                   | Human Strength                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Architecture     | Picks plausible pattern       | Chooses correct pattern under tradeoffs |
| Evaluation       | Can’t judge long-term quality | Has taste & historical memory           |
| Longevity        | Optimizes for now             | Designs for decades                     |
| Security         | Misses adversarial thinking   | Thinks like attacker                    |
| Global coherence | Local optimization            | System-level integrity                  |
| Infra            | Config generation             | Real-world debugging                    |
| Reuse judgment   | Over-generates                | Knows when to depend                    |
| Risk             | No accountability             | Bears consequences                      |
| Strategy         | Executes                      | Chooses direction                       |
