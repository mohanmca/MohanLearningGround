* When to stay and when to quit? (Anonymous heuristics)
  1. If you like the people you work with (I.e. They're not morons)
  1. If you like the work and you feel you're making an impact and learning 
  1. If your happy days is more than 50% of all your days
  1. Then if the pay works for you, then staying seems reasonable
  
* Quit
  * Quit your job if you're more often bored/dissatisfied with your days at work
  * Quit your job if you're bored, underpaid, and abused. Don't be scared :)
  
* The second employees start looking elsewhere, they're as good as gone. For two reasons:
  * If you gave them a reason to look elsewhere, odds are you are not offering them enough (again, this includes traditional compensation + intangibles), so if they start looking around, they will likely find something better.
  * If you gave them a reason to look elsewhere, there is a very decent chance you have already lost them as productive employees no matter what.

* Your only long term responsibility is to yourself:
* Employers don't struggle with these moral issues when they decide to get rid of you. You got to do what's best for you, nobody in that company is going to shed a tear.
