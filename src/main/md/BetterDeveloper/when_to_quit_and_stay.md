* When to stay and when to quit? (Anonymous heuristics)
  * 1. If you like the people you work with (I.e. They're not morons)
  * 2. If you like the work and you feel you're making an impact and learning 
  * 3. If your happy days is more than 50% of all your days
  * 4. Then if the pay works for you, then staying seems reasonable
