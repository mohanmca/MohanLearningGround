## When to Anki?
1. In general I suggest putting in information at the end of a study session when you feel like you know it so well you couldn't possibly forget it.
2. Cards should feel a bit too easy when you create them.
3. By the time you come to review you will have forgotten a little and the difficulty will be perfect.

## Mistakes in Anki
1. Putting far too many cards in a deck.
2. Putting in information that you want to learn rather than information you have already learned.
