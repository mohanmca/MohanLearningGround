## Framework Rules
1. Columns have no order
   1. (No priority)
   2. All columns are equally important
2. Each column has a simple and basic model
3. Basic model of each column is unique
4. Each row represents a distinct view/perspective
5. Each cell is unique
   1. It is not like periodic table (many columns exhibits same nature and properties)
6. Combining the cells in one row forms a complete description from that view
   1. Every row represents the same, but for different people
