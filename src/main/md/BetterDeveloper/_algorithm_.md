*  To determine that two words are anagrams of each other, you can assign each letter to a unique prime number (a = 2, b = 3, c = 5 etc.), then compute the product of those numbers, and if they're equal then those two words are anagrams.

  *  By indexing the grid using values from a 3x3 magic square[1]. In a magic square, every row, column, and diagonal has the same sum. So checking for a winner was just checking if a player�s three moves added up to 15. Finding a space that would make the computer win, or block the human opponent from winning, was subtracting two moves from 15 and checking if that spot was available.
