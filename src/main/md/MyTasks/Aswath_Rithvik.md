# Rules
* Read your questions properly, if you read question wrong, your answer will be always wrong
* Loose concentration, become a fool
  * Use 1-2-3 to gain concentration, Close your eyes, deep breath 5 times, think only your breath

# Number System
# Rational Numbers:
* Properties of rational numbers. (including identities). Using general form of expression to describe properties
* Consolidation of operations on rational numbers.
* Representation of rational numbers on the number line
* Between any two rational numbers there lies another rational number (Making children see that if we take two rational numbers then unlike for whole numbers, in this case you can keep finding more and more numbers that lie between them.)
* Word problem (higher logic two operations, including ideas like area)

# Powers
* Integers as exponents.
* Laws of exponents with integral powers
* Squares, Square roots, Cubes, Cube roots
* Square roots using factor method and division method for numbers containing (a) no more than total 4 digits  nd (b) no more than 2 decimal places
* Cubes and cubes roots (only factor method for numbers containing at most 3 digits)
* Estimating square roots and cube roots. Learning the process of moving nearer to the required number. (iv) Playing with numbers
* Writing and understanding a 2 and 3 digit number in generalized form (100a + 10b + c , where a, b, c can be only digit 0-9) and engaging with various puzzles concerning this. (Like finding the missing numerals represented by alphabets in sums involving any of the four operations.) Children to solve and create problems and puzzles.
* Number puzzles and games
* Deducing the divisibility test rules of 2, 3, 5, 9, 10 for a two or three-digit number expressed in the general form.


# Algebra
* Algebraic Expressions
* Multiplication and division of algebraic exp.(Coefficient should be integers)
* Some common errors (e.g. 2 + x <> 2x, 7x + y . 7xy )
* Identities (a ± b)2 = a2 ± 2ab + b2, )2 a2 – b2 = (a – b) (a + b) Factorisation (simple cases only) as examples the following types a(x + y), (x ± y)2, a2 – b2, (x + a).(x + b) Solving linear equations in one variable in contextual problems involving multiplication and division (word problems) (avoid complex coefficient in the equations)

# Ratio and Proportion
*  Slightly advanced problems involving applications on percentages, profit & loss, overhead expenses, Discount, tax.
* Difference between simple and compound interest (compounded yearly up to 3 years or half-yearly up to 3 steps only), Arriving at the formula for compound interest through patterns and using it for simple problems.
* Direct variation – Simple and direct word problems
* Inverse variation – Simple and direct word problems
* Time & work problems– Simple and direct word problems
