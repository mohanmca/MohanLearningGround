## RestFul URL and  content search engine 
    a. Objective: Many restful url has plenty of data, but we can't search using every different url
    b. Admin page, list all existing registered url, accept new restful-url + name + jpath expression to find presence of result
    c. Search page, accept the content and search in all the url, display the content
    d. pay attention to "bootstrap.zero"
