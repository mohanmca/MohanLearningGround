##  What Is Sleep Apnea?

1. Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder that happens when your breathing stops and starts while you slumber. If it goes untreated, it can cause loud snoring, daytime tiredness, or more serious problems like heart trouble or high blood pressure.

2. This condition is different from regular, or primary, snoring. Primary snoring can be caused by nose or throat conditions, sleep style (especially back sleeping), being overweight or of an older age, or the use of alcohol or other depressants. While primary snoring and sleep apnea-related snoring both happen when the tissues in the back of your throat vibrate, people with sleep apnea tend to:

## Problems
1. Snore much louder than those with regular snoring
2. Pause while they breathe (for over 10 seconds)
3. Take shallow breaths, gasp, or choke
4. Be restless


## What Are the Symptoms of Sleep Apnea?

You usually won’t notice your first symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea. Instead, your bed partner may make you aware of them. The most common signs and symptoms are:

1. Snoring
2. Fatigue or sleepiness during the day
3. Restlessness while sleeping, or regular nighttime awakenings
4. Dry mouth or sore throat when you wake up
5. Waking up suddenly after gasping or choking
6. Trouble concentrating, forgetfulness, or crankiness
7. Depression or anxiety
8. Constant need to go pee at night
9. Night sweats
10. Sexual dysfunction
11. Headaches 
12. Sluggishness or sleepiness, which others may mistake as laziness in the classroom
13. Poor school performance
14. Trouble swallowing
15. Daytime mouth breathing
16. Inward movement of the rib cage when inhaling
17. Sweating a lot at night
18. Unusual sleeping positions, like sleeping on the hands and knees, or with the neck hyperextended
19. Bedwetting
20. Learning and behavioral disorders

## How Is Sleep Apnea Treated?

1. If your doctor finds that you have sleep apnea, they’ll suggest treatment based on how serious your condition is. For mild cases, you may only need to make lifestyle changes. They may ask you to lose weight, stop smoking, or treat nasal allergies (if you have any).
2. If these don’t ease your symptoms or if you have a moderate to severe case of sleep apnea, your doctor will recommend other treatments:

## Sleep Apnea Complications
1. Untreated sleep apnea can cause serious medical conditions such as:
2. Daytime fatigue. Sleep apnea may cause you to repeatedly wake up. This can make it hard to get normal, healthy sleep. This can lead to daytime sleepiness and crankiness. Daytime fatigue can cause you to fall asleep at work or school and make it more likely to get in vehicle or workplace accidents.
3. High blood pressure or heart problems. Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels while you sleep can heighten your blood pressure and put stress on your cardiovascular system. Obstructive sleep apnea could also put you more at risk for recurrent heart attacks, strokes, or abnormal heartbeats.
4. Type 2 diabetes. Sleep apnea puts you at a higher risk for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
5. Metabolic syndrome. Doctors found that this condition (which includes high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, high blood sugar, and a larger waistline) can lead to a higher risk of heart disease. 
6. Issues with medications and surgery. Obstructive sleep apnea can cause people to have issues with certain drugs or after major surgery because they’re more likely to have breathing problems (especially when under anesthesia or lying on their backs). 
7. Liver complications. Sleep apnea can cause people to have abnormal results on liver function tests. Their livers are also more likely to show signs of scarring.


## Are You at Risk for Sleep Apnea?

1. This condition can affect anyone, but some things put you more at risk:
2. Being overweight
3. A large neck circumference that could make your airways more narrow
4. A narrowed airway that you inherited or developed from large tonsils or adenoids
5. Being male
6. Older age
7. A family history of sleep apnea
8. Smoking
9. Use of alcohol, sedatives, or tranquilizers
10. Nasal congestion
11. Medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes, congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, Parkinson's disease, PCOS, hormonal disorders, prior stroke, or chronic lung diseases like asthma
