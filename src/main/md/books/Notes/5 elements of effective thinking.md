# Essential thinking
* Thought provking ideas to provke thoughts
* Curiousity, Obsession, Dogged Endurance, Combined with Self-Criticism bring new ideas (Einestein)
* Education is all about how we solve problems even after forgetting everything that we learnt

## Esential & Core
* Master the core
* Shadows are colors of the sky
* What does the Picasso - "The Bull" diagram teaches?
* Cut the bull, describe what you see (Stop assuming, bullshit)
* Earth
  * Earth - Deep understanding
  * Fire - Effective Failure
  * Air  - Question
  * Water - Flow of Idea

## Understand Deeply
* Understanding is not yes/no, it is spectrum
* We understand some aspect of understanding
* There are aspects of this issue that I don't understand, I now must uncover them and work toward making greater meaning.

1. Start with simple
    * When complex issue is encountered
    * Find simplest problem that is still unsolvable
    * find simper version of it, and solve it
1. Spot the specific
   * Find special case and scrtuanize micro-level details, and try to generalize
1. Add the adjuctive
    * Challenge yourself to add as many as adjective as possible
    * Do not leave an adjective for another descriptor untill some new facet is revealed
    * Uncover the hidden confusion or misunderstanding using new adjectives
    * First-world-war, the war that ends all the war, 2nd world-war

## Fail Effectively
* We may not know what is the right way to do it right, but we can always start with someting wrong
* Failure as a process to solve the problem
  * Kid solving 36 into to two halves
  * Find answer something definitely it is wrong (16)
  * He answered 16, and successive question, what makes to prove that 16 is wrong?
  * Kid came back with 18 is the answer
* There is no better teacher than one's own failure, but stay with failure and learn a new lesson
* Fail fast
  * Fail fast, revise, rethink and relearn
  * Don't stare at screen, rather fail fast with new draft mail
  * Don't stare at screen, rather fail fast with buggy code that doesn't even compile
* Fail again - n times
  * For enormous task, should fail n times before succeeding
  * One failure done, nine to go
* Fail intentionally
  * Clever failed ideas are started as failed attempts
----
## Create questions
* Creating questions makes us from bystander to active participant
* Prompt - "What are your questions?"
* What are your questions to share with this group?
* One who raises question is open minded
* What is the real issue here?
* Raise "What if questions?"
* Fundamental Question
  * What does  the simples case look like?
  * What happens in that trivial situation?
* Ask something else
  * What is a different but related question?
  * What is the opposite point of view?
----
## Go with the Flow of Ideas
* With one idea in hand, what is next?
* Extend the current idea
* Generalize
* Reapply this new notion
* Run down all the paths of ideas till the  dead-end and learn, and come back
----
## Embrace Doubt
* Opposite of doubt is not certainity, it is closed mind
* What if I am wrong?
* Empathize without sympathize for opposite view
* Live and believe opposite view for certain time as if it logically make sense
* Live like thiest for a week, and athiest for a week. Try and experiment alternate

## Never stop the idea
* Tenacity and Perseverance is very important to learn the complete impact about the idea
----
## Be open to change
* Small and incremental changes will transform how we think and engage with the world
* How we see a problem wille effectively change about our perception over period of time
