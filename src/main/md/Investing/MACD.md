# Moving convergence and divergence indicator

* 12, 26, 9 - Days as base
  * Fast and slow moving average (26 and 12)
* Difference between 12 and 26 with base as 9
* 9 - Signale line
* Centered Oscilator
* Centered oscilators 
  * Are good to find Strength or Weakness
  * To find direction of momentum
* MACD centerline = macd zero line  
* When MACD line is going below zero, 26 day moving average is going below 12 day moving average - Bearish
* When histogram is +ve, MACD is above 9 days moving average
* When histogram is -ve, MACD is below 9 days moving average

# 3 signals from MACD

* MACD/Signal cross over - lagging
* MACD centerline cross over - reliable for long term (12 EMA cross 26)
* Divergence with price - Most powerful and leading indicator
  * Occurs least often

# general signals from MACD

* MACD crossing zero-line (from below to above zero) is considered bullish
* Crossing center-line is lagging, but very reliable

# MACD Histogram

* Histogram is indicator for MACD indicator, very powerful
* Histogram represents difference between MACD and signl line
* Movements in the histogram is independent of MACD line itself
* Changes in the MACD direction often preceded by divergence in the histogram
  * If histogram successive lows should indicate the MACD line like a leading indicator


# Powerful convergence and divergence

* Divergence - diverging with trend of the underlying price (acts as leading indicator)
  * Price hits higher and higher, but MACD hits lower highs.. (or vice versa)
* MACD line diverges with the actual price, and act as leading indicator
  * When MACD's successive high are falling whereas actual price is going high, change is immenient, it would crash
    * Higher highs in price, lower lows in MACD, bearish
  * When MACD's successive lows are increases whereas actual price is going low, change is immenient, it would be bullish
    * Lower lows in price, higher high in MACD, bullish

# Oscilators

* When oscilators are below zero line - bearish mode
* When oscilators are above zero line - bearish mode
* Moving averages are lagging indicators
* Exponential moving averages are faster than simple moving averages


# For effective MACD usage

* Use this in combination with other banded indicator such as RSI/CCI/Stochaistic
* That would help to find overbought or oversold indication
