1. Are there external factors influencing this requirement?

## *Clarify Ambiguities*

1. Are there any vague or unclear terms?
1. Could this be interpreted in multiple ways?
1. Have I defined all key terms precisely?

## *Probe for Deeper Understanding*

1. What's the underlying need behind this requirement?
1. Why is this important to the stakeholder?
1. What problem is this really trying to solve?

## *Challenge Constraints*

1. Are the stated constraints truly fixed?
1. What if we relaxed or changed a constraint?
1. Are there unstated constraints limiting our thinking?

## *Explore Alternatives*

1. What are other ways to meet this need?
1. Have we considered non-obvious solutions?
1. What would a completely different approach look like?

## *Anticipate Consequences*

1. What are potential unintended effects?
