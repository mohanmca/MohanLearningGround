## Notes from Rajan
1. He doesn't trust his memory, and believes that he is so bad at remembering things.
2. He also  believs that he likes to solve problem, but lack any prior knowledge in anything, For example, he codes in python, but can't guess the library that can parse html, since never handled it
3. He loves to use tool, (Lense to read screen)

## Tip-1 from Rajan
1. Draw everything as you learn to help create and visualize mental models.
1. Maintain neat drawings and share them with friends and colleagues to quickly understand their mental models as well.
1. Preserve your drawings as they become valuable assets and common knowledge for others to reference.
1. Practice teaching what you learn; it helps identify your own gaps in understanding.
1. Use simple drawing tools like Gliffy or Draw.io to avoid unnecessary complexity.
1. Don’t just learn out of curiosity—use diagrams to build mental models and connect new knowledge to existing concepts.
1. Keep a small diary to jot down inspiring questions and thoughts, gradually accumulating valuable knowledge.
1. Engage in discussions and debates to share your diagrams and notes. When they are reviewed by others, they become even more useful.


## What is First Principles Thinking?
1. “A first principle is a basic assumption that cannot be deduced any further.
  1. Boil things down to the most fundamental truths you can imagine and reason up from there

1. First principles thinking that’s fused with contrarian views and horizontal + vertical depth of analysis
  1. Identify underlying assumptions
  1. Challenge conventional wisdom - considering alternative perspectives that go against the mainstream
  1. Develop innovative solutions

## What is First Principles Thinking - Framework?
1. Start with the most basic truths
1. Use these truths to understand the nature of the problem
1. Develop solutions that are based on these fundamental truths
