## Notes from Rajan
1. He doesn't trust his memory, and believes that he is so bad at remembering things.
2. He also  believes that he likes to solve problem, but lack any prior knowledge in anything, For example, he codes in python, but can't guess the library that can parse html, since never handled it

## [Tip about drawing as thinking and notes taking - from Rajan]
1. Draw everything as you learn to help create and visualize mental models.
1. Maintain neat drawings and share them with friends and colleagues to quickly understand their mental models as well.
1. Preserve your drawings as they become valuable assets and common knowledge for others to reference.
1. Practice teaching what you learn; it helps identify your own gaps in understanding.
1. Use simple drawing tools like Gliffy or Draw.io to avoid unnecessary complexity.
1. Don’t just learn out of curiosity—use diagrams to build mental models and connect new knowledge to existing concepts.
1. Keep a small diary to jot down inspiring questions and thoughts, gradually accumulating valuable knowledge.
1. Engage in discussions and debates to share your diagrams and notes. When they are reviewed by others, they become even more useful.

## Awarness and knowing well with exact sample are different level of knowledge.
1. Knowing about Run-length-encoding is one
2. Knowing how multiple product details are stored using bitma-index inside parquet file and encoded using RLE with sample data would be different level of knowledge
