## What is real learning

1. Higher impact learning is often uncomfortable learning
1. How to ask good questions.
1. How to effectively fail
1. Try again and every failure should change your mind
1. Come up with as many different ways of thinking about it as possible

## True learning emerges from

1. Messing things up
2. Challenging basic assumptions
3. Try new unexpected directions
4. Incremental and subtle improvements (not revolutionary, it is evolutionary)

## What is Thinking

1. Effective thinking is skill
2. Practicing by analyzing different situations from different angles
3. Effective thiking is not...
4. Analyze pros and cons of all the options available

## If thinking is physical

1. Think straight
2. Think upside down
3. Think mirror image
4. Inversion thinking
    1. How to spoilt something
    2. How to make it fail
    3. How to destroy

## Notes from Rajan

1. He doesn't trust his memory, and believes that he is so bad at remembering things.
2. He also believes that he likes to solve problem, but lack any prior knowledge in anything, For example, he codes in
   python, but can't guess the library that can parse html, since never handled it
3. He loves to use tool, (Lense to read screen)

## [Tip about drawing as thinking and notes taking - from Rajan]

1. Draw everything as you learn to help create and visualize mental models.
1. Maintain neat drawings and share them with friends and colleagues to quickly understand their mental models as well.
1. Preserve your drawings as they become valuable assets and common knowledge for others to reference.
1. Practice teaching what you learn; it helps identify your own gaps in understanding.
1. Use simple drawing tools like Gliffy or Draw.io to avoid unnecessary complexity.
1. Don’t just learn out of curiosity—use diagrams to build mental models and connect new knowledge to existing concepts.
1. Keep a small diary to jot down inspiring questions and thoughts, gradually accumulating valuable knowledge.
1. Engage in discussions and debates to share your diagrams and notes. When they are reviewed by others, they become
   even more useful.

## Awarness and knowing well with exact sample are different level of knowledge.

1. Knowing about Run-length-encoding is one
2. Knowing how multiple product details are stored using bitma-index inside parquet file and encoded using RLE with
   sample data would be different level of knowledge

## Improve problem solving skills

1. Solve problems
1. Afterward, reflect on what went well and what didn't
1. Write down what you should have done differently
1. Solve more problems, keep those notes handy
1. Repeat

## What is First Principles Thinking?

1. “A first principle is a basic assumption that cannot be deduced any further.
1. Boil things down to the most fundamental truths you can imagine and reason up from there
1. Aristotle defined a first principle as “the first basis from which a thing is known.”
1. First principles thinking that’s fused with contrarian views and horizontal + vertical depth of analysis
1. Identify underlying assumptions
1. Challenge conventional wisdom - considering alternative perspectives that go against the mainstream
1. Develop innovative solutions

## One of the tools to solve problem

1. When we solve a problem that has many facts, we might stuck by missing one or two fact, or we might misinterpret one
   or two fact
2. To overcome this issue
    1. Interpret facts from top to bottom and write down
    1. Interpret facts from bottom to top and write down
3. You might notice the missing fact

## What is First Principles Thinking - Framework?

1. Start with the most basic truths
1. Use these truths to understand the nature of the problem
1. Develop solutions that are based on these fundamental truths

## [Effective thinking](https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-the-5-elements-of-effective-thinking/)

1. Ground your Thinking (Earth): Understand Deeply
2. Ignite Insights through Failure (Fire): Learn from Mistakes
3. Create Questions from Thin Air (Air): Ask Challenging Questions
4. Tap on the Flow of Ideas (Water): Look Forward & Backward
5. Transform yourself (The Quintessential Element): Engage Change

## Understand deeply

1. Practicing basics daily - trumphet
2. Take a paper and try to write 5 paragraphs about something that we want to master
3. Find the simple problem than this, create similar smaller problem to understand this problem bigger
4. Make invisible visible
5. Add adjective and understand, create as many adjective as possible
6. Learning is a spectrum, not binary
7. Have microscoping view of the same problem
8. Teach to someone and understand deeply

## Understand deeply

1. It is spectrum
    1. Where are we within the spectrum
    2. How to measure
    3. How we arrived now with the current knowledge
    4. How to move from this stage
3. Start with simple and basics
    1. Direct simple case with good depth details
5. Spotlight on specific
    1. Think microleve... so macrolevel
7. Add as many adjectives as possible

## Fail Effectively

1. Learn new insight from every of your failure
1. Fail fast - focus on process by faily quickly
    1. start with some junk and keep remove failure
    1. For every failure - count there are 9 more to go
1. Fail intentionally
1. Fail quickly and find why you failed, and use binary search to go towards proper answer

## Effective Failure as learning tools

1. Fail effectively
    1. We can always fail quickly
    2. Gain new insight from failure
    3. Never waste a failure without learning a lesson
3. Fail fast
    1. Focus on process
    2. Don't strare blank screen, start something and fail
5. Fail again
    1. "If at first, you don't succeed, then skydiving definitely isn't for you"
    2. Fail 10 times, so 9 more to go
    3. Every failure gives learning
    4. After 10 failure, our basic assumptions are wrong
7. Fail Intentionally
    8. Stress test and make it fail
    9. Degerate the puzzle and make it fail
    10. Use it to the extreem and observe failure
9. Learn from others failures

## Create questions

1. Force more questions - forced to listen, leads to deeper understanding
2. Be socrates - Ask what is the problem here?
    3. Never ask "Non productive question"
    3.
        4. Rather asking "How to manage large traffic jam, think how to use it effectively"
3. What if .... question?
4. Create basic questions
    1. Generating questions will lead to a deeper understanding
5. What if our prevous assumption was wrong? What if two weight travel at different speed if dropped from sky-scrapper?
6. Question to learn, not question to suspect (Spritual advise)

## Generate oposite view - questions current stand

1. What is different but releated view
2. From post, landline to smarphone, what next?
1. Run down all the path and understand all the failures and its natures
2. Embrace doubt, show empathy not necessary about sympathy

## Go with flow

1. What comes next?
2. What was the problem before this problem exists? Think from historical perspective, go 50 years back and forward
3. Run down all the paths
4. Embrace doubt - empathy
    1. Consider alternative and opposite side and understand. Bohr - every hour accepted quantum was right
    2. Open mind for opponenets view
5. Never stop the flow of ideas

## Be part of change - keep practice

1. Quintessential element

## How to practice for "Analysing problem systematically? Or How to scientifically systematically analyse problem? and how to practice for it?
