## Notes from Rajan
1. He doesn't trust his memory, and believes that he is so bad at remembering things.
2. He also  believes that he likes to solve problem, but lack any prior knowledge in anything, For example, he codes in python, but can't guess the library that can parse html, since never handled it
3. He loves to use tool, (Lense to read screen)

## [Tip about drawing as thinking and notes taking - from Rajan]
1. Draw everything as you learn to help create and visualize mental models.
1. Maintain neat drawings and share them with friends and colleagues to quickly understand their mental models as well.
1. Preserve your drawings as they become valuable assets and common knowledge for others to reference.
1. Practice teaching what you learn; it helps identify your own gaps in understanding.
1. Use simple drawing tools like Gliffy or Draw.io to avoid unnecessary complexity.
1. Don’t just learn out of curiosity—use diagrams to build mental models and connect new knowledge to existing concepts.
1. Keep a small diary to jot down inspiring questions and thoughts, gradually accumulating valuable knowledge.
1. Engage in discussions and debates to share your diagrams and notes. When they are reviewed by others, they become even more useful.

## Awarness and knowing well with exact sample are different level of knowledge.
1. Knowing about Run-length-encoding is one
2. Knowing how multiple product details are stored using bitma-index inside parquet file and encoded using RLE with sample data would be different level of knowledge

## Improve problem solving skills
* Solve problems
* Afterward, reflect on what went well and what didn't
* Write down what you should have done differently
* Solve more problems, keep those notes handy
* Repeat

## What is First Principles Thinking?
1. “A first principle is a basic assumption that cannot be deduced any further.
  1. Boil things down to the most fundamental truths you can imagine and reason up from there
  1. Aristotle defined a first principle as “the first basis from which a thing is known.”
1. First principles thinking that’s fused with contrarian views and horizontal + vertical depth of analysis
  1. Identify underlying assumptions
  1. Challenge conventional wisdom - considering alternative perspectives that go against the mainstream
  1. Develop innovative solutions

## One of the tools to solve problem
1. When we solve a problem that has many facts, we might stuck by missing one or two fact, or we might misinterpret one or two fact
2. To overcome this issue
    1. Interpret facts from top to bottom and write down
    1. Interpret facts from bottom to top and write down
3. You might notice the missing fact

## What is First Principles Thinking - Framework?
1. Start with the most basic truths
1. Use these truths to understand the nature of the problem
1. Develop solutions that are based on these fundamental truths

## Effective thinking
1. Understand deeply
2. Fail effectively
3. Create questions
4. Go with flow
5. Adopt change

## Understand deeply
1. Practicing basics daily - trumphet
2. Take a paper and try to write 5 paragraphs about something that we want to master
3. Find the simple problem than this, create similar smaller problem to understand this problem bigger
4. Make invisible visible
5. Add adjective and understand, create as many adjective as possible
6. Learning is a spectrum, not binary
7. Have microscoping view of the same problem

## Fail Effectively
1. Learn new insight from every of your failure
1. Fail fast - focus on process by faily quickly
   1. start with some junk and keep remove failure
   1. For every failure - count there are 9 more to go
1. Fail intentionally
1. Fail quickly and find why you failed, and use binary search to go towards proper answer

## Create questions
1. Force more questions - forced to listen, leads to deeper understanding
2. Be socrates - Ask what is the problem here?
3. What if .... question?
4. Create basic questions
5. What if our prevous assumption was wrong? What if two weight travel at different speed if dropped from sky-scrapper?

## Go with flow
1. What comes next?
2. What was the problem before this problem exists? Think from historical perspective, go 50 years back and forward
3. Run down all the paths
4. Embrace doubt - empathy
   1. Consider alternative and opposite side and understand. Bohr - every hour accepted quantum was right
   2. Open mind for opponenets view
5. Never stop the flow of ideas

## Be part of change - keep practice
1. Quintessential element
