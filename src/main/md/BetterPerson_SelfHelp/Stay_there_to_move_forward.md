# There are few ways to move forward,
  * Extreeme focus on the ultimate goal and keep moving towards it. But won't work when the goal itself not worth to die for, or goal itself not clear.
  * Question everything that you do, if it is not worth few years from now, discard it now.
    * Lesser the rubbish would leads to find the true of you

# Is it spritual exercise?
* No! It is treating addication, here both the patient and doctor are the same.

# Are there any guiding principle?
* On which you invest would grow!
* Anything optional, say no!
* Adopt the boredom, boredom is not part of life, it is life!
* Chase the pain
  * Test if will-power theory is true, (Would abstaining coffee would drain my day?)

# What is the problem?
  * Extreeme distractions, where mind started wandering, and it took control of itself. There is no-navigator

# What I discovered by reducing social-network
  * My old sweet day-dreams, where I am the hero, the best cricket batsman who can hit 6-6's in the very first over of the best bowler. Where does it leads me to, I don't know, but I enjoy this. IGNORANCE is bliss
  * Observing that still distracted, but definitely able to conquer it, witnessing the navigator, who is able to cheat the mind wandering few times
  * Observing people, and they are also having short span of attention
  * Observing friends who are scared about their future (few I considered as leaders)
  * Observing people who lost jobs, and judging why they might have lost it
