"Provide a detailed explanation of the psychological, cognitive, and logical reasons why individuals with deep fluency in a few specific areas often perform better in complex tasks than those with broader but shallower knowledge across many areas. Include examples from fields like coding interviews (e.g., LeetCode patterns), expertise research, and problem-solving. Draw on concepts such as pattern recognition, cognitive load, automaticity, and knowledge organization. Structure the response with clear sections, use bullet points or numbered lists for reasons, and suggest practical implications."
